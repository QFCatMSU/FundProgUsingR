    "text": "2 Output to console\nThe Console tab has many uses and one of them is to output messages from a script – the messages can contain text, variable, or some combination of the two.  Outputting messages to the Console can be done using the function cat(), which stands for concatenate. This is R’s way of saying that cat() will concatenate (combine) variables and values to create an output.\n \nExtension: cat() vs print()\n\n2.1 Output a message\nWe will first use cat() to output a text message to the Console tab – to do this we need to put the message in quotes:\ncat(\"Hello\");\n\n\n\nHello\n\n\nFigure 1: Outputting a text message in the Console tab\n\n\n\nIf you do not use quotes (” “), R will think you are referring to a variable.  For instance, the line cat(Hello) gives you the Object not found error because R thinks this is a reference to a variable named Hello – and, in this case, there is no variable named Hello. \ncat(Hello); # Will cause an «object not found» error\n\n\n\nError in cat(Hello) : object Hello not found\n\n\nFigure 2: An error that occurs if you try to output a variable (object) that does not exist in your script.\n\n\n\nNote: If there is a variable named Hello in your script, then cat(Hello); will output the value of the variable Hello.\n\n\n2.2 Output multiple messages\nYou can add as many cat() statements to your script as you like and they will be displayed sequentially in the Console tab:\ncat(\"Hello, World.\");\ncat(\"How are you?\");\ncat(\"I am fine.\");\n\n\n\nHello World. How are you? I am fine.\n\n\nFigure 3: Output message without spacing\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 The line feed: \\n\nBut there is a problem here – R puts no spacing in between the lines (Fig.##).  This is typical behavior of programming languages – they do not add line feeds (e.g., enter or return) unless the script specifically requests that a line feed is added.\n \nThe instruction to add a line feed is to put \\n inside the quotes ( “ ” ):\ncat(\"Hello, World.\\n\");\ncat(\"How are you?\\n\");\ncat(\"I am\\n fine.\\n\");\n\n\n\nHello, World\nHow are you?\nI am\n fine.\n\n\nFigure 4: Message with line feeds\n\n\n\nIn Figure 4 we have our text on multiple lines.  Notice that the \\n does not get printed to the screen.  \\n is an instruction inside the message to add a line feed, sometimes called a newline character, and needs to be put inside the quotes.\n \n\\n can be put anywhere in a quote.  In the above code there is a \\n put in between “am” and “fine”, hence the line feed between the two words.  The exact same message as Figure 4 can be output to the Console Window using only one cat() statement with multiple \\n:\ncat(\"Hello, World.\\nHow are you?\\nI am\\n fine?\\n\");\n\n\n\nHello, World\nHow are you?\nI am\n fine.\n\n\nFigure 5: Using one cat() statement with multiple \\n to output multiple lines of text",

These all have default values (e.g., file=““, sep=” “)\n\n7.1 The sep argument\nArguments are used to modify the behavior of a function.  sep changes how the different components of the output are separated– the default is to use 1 space.  We are going to change the sep argument.\n \nLet’s take the code from above and add the sep argument to cat() and give sep the value ” ** “:\n  cat(\"Day 5-9 temperature:\", lowTemps[5:9], \"\\n\", \n      \"Temp on odd days:\", lowTemps[seq(from=1, by=2, to=10)], \"\\n\",\n      sep = \" ** \");\nAnd you will notice that the different components in cat() are separated by ” ** “.\n\n\n\nDay 5-9 temperature: ** 36 ** 45 ** 32 ** 50 ** 48 ** \n ** Temp on odd days: ** 45 ** 46 ** 36 ** 32 ** 48 ** \n\n\nFigure 14: Using the sep argument in cat()\n\n\n\nNote: The most common way people use sep is to set sep=““– in other words, set sep to nothing so nothing is added to the output.\n \nTrap: Misplacing (or forgetting) quotes\n\n\n7.2 The file argument\nBy default, cat() will output to the Console.

    "text": "4 A simpler function: median()\nLet’s take a step back and look at a simpler function, median(), which takes a vector and finds the median value in the vector.\n \nTo use median() we need a vector with numeric values in it:\nvec1 = c(3,4,5,6,21,45,61);\nAnd then we pass vec1 in as an argument to the median() function:\nmedianVal1 = median(vec1);\nAnd the Environment says that the returned values, saved to medianVal1 is 6\nmedianVal1:   6\n\n4.1 Help for median()\nNow let’s use RStudio’s Help tab to go behind-the-scenes of median().  RStudio Help tab is a useful resource for finding out more information on functions.\n \nIf we type median in the search bar we get this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The median function in the Help tab in RStudio\n\n\n\n \nThe Help page shows that median() has two arguments:\n\nx: the vector that you want to find the median for\nna.rm: a TRUE/FALSE value that determines how to handle NA values in the vector\n\nNA means Not Available – usually indicating a problem with the data\n\n\n \nNote: the ( … ) can be ignored – it is basically R saying that this function can be expanded with more arguments\n\n\n4.2 Skipping argument names\nWhen we called median(), we did not include any argument names:\nmedianVal1 = median(vec1);\nHowever, since x is the first argument in median(), it is assumed that the first value is meant to be for x.\n \nSo, this is an equivalent call to median() that more explicitly says that the vec1 is the value for x:\nmedianVal1b = median(x=vec1);\nmedianVal1:   6\nmedianVal1b:  6\n\n\n4.3 Default argument values\nThe other argument in median(), na.rm, already has a value: FALSE .   This means that you do not have to supply a value for the argument na.rm when you call the function.  You only need to supply a value if you want to change na.rm to something other than FALSE (e.g., TRUE).\n \nOur first example did not have an NA values, let’s create a vector with an NA value in it:\nvec2 = c(3,4,5,NA,6,21,45,61);\nAnd then use that as an argument for median():\nmedianVal2 = median(x=vec2);\nThis time the median value is NA because the median value for any vector that has an NA value is NA (essentially saying that median cannot be determined)\nmedianVal2:   NA_real_\nnote: NA_real_ means an NA value that R thinks should be a real number\n\n\n4.4 Dealing with the NA\nna.rm is the argument that determines whether NA values are removed from the vector – and the default value is FALSE, meaning NA values are not removed.\n \nLet’s set na.rm to TRUE so the NA values are removed before finding the median:\nmedianVal2b = median(x=vec2, na.rm=TRUE);\nNow, we get the same median value as before:\nmedianVal2b:   6\n\n\n4.5 Alternate ways to call median()\nArgument names (e.g., x and na.rm) are not needed if you put values in the correct order. All of these calls functionally do the same thing as the above median() call:\nmedianVal2c = median(vec2, TRUE);\nmedianVal2d = median(vec2, na.rm=TRUE);\nmedianVal2e = median(na.rm=TRUE, x=vec2);  # can reverse arguments if you name them\nmedianVal2f = median(x=vec2, TRUE);\nMy general recommendation is to always use argument names when calling a function.  This makes your code easier to read and you don’t have to worry about the order of the arguments.  This is especially important when you are dealing with more complicated functions that have lots of arguments (e.g., plotting functions).",

    "text": "6 read.csv() expanded\nWhen you go to the Help page for read.csv() , you are actually taken to the Help page for read.table(). This is because read.csv() is a version of the function read.table().  In other words, read.csv() is read.table() with different default values for the arguments (underlined in Fig.##).\n \nFor instance, the default value for sep (the separator) is a space in read.table() and a comma in read.csv().  Note: some of the default arguments (e.g., quote, dec) in read.csv() are the same as in read.table().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Using the Help tab in RStudio to look up functions\n\n\n\n\n6.1 read.csv arguments\nWhen you call read.csv(), you can use any of the argument from read.table().\n \nAnd there are a lot of arguments in read.table(). The majority of these arguments rarely need to be changed from their default value.\n \nMost of the arguments in read.table() look cryptic and you will probably never have to use them. A couple that are easier to understand:\n\ndecimal: the character that represents a decimal in the decimal number.  You might need to change this to a comma ( , ) if you get data from Europe\ncomment.char: the character after which everything on the line is a comment (i.e., not data)\n\nnotice that read.csv() has no comment.char whereas read.table() uses ( # ) as the default comment.char\n\n\n\n\n6.2 Required arguments and default arguments\nfile is the only argument not set equal to anything in read.table() / read.csv().  This is because file must be supplied by the user –file is the only required argument.  This should make sense as there is no point in calling read.table() / read.csv() without any data.\n \nEvery other argument in read.table() / read.csv() has a default value– this means you can execute the function without using any argument except file.\n \nIn fact, the following code will produce the same results as the earlier read.csv() call in Fig.##:\nweatherData2 = read.csv(file = \"data/twoWeekWeatherData.csv\");\nIf you look in the Environment tab the values for weatherData and weatherData2 are exactly the same.\n&lt;image&gt;\nExpanding weatherData and weatherData2 in the Environment tab\n\n\n6.3 The other arguments (aside from file)\nIn my original call to read.csv(), the arguments sep=“,” and header=TRUE are functionally not changing anything because I have them set to the same value as their default.  But, these arguments are changed often enough that it is nice to have them quickly at hand when copying read.csv() from one script to another.\n \n&lt;explain more about sep and header&gt;\n weatherData3 = read.csv(file=\"data/twoWeekWeatherData.csv\",\n                         sep=\",\",                 \n                         header=TRUE);",

    "text": "3 Putting a formula in code\nOnce again, we will calculate velocity using distance and time, except, we will now use the full version of the velocity formula, which looks at the changes in distance and time as opposed to absolute distance and time.\n \nThe full velocity formula is (subscript i means initial, subscript f means final):\n\\(v=\\frac{d_{f}-d_{i}}{t_{f}-t_{i}}\\) (If ti and di are zero then you get the formula we used in Lesson 1-2: (\\(\\boldsymbol{v}=\\frac{d}{t}\\))\n \nWe are going to code this formula, but there are a couple of issues:\n\nfractions are “stacked” – but in scripts, equations can only be read left to right\nvariable names have subscript characters (e.g., ti), but subscript and superscript characters are not allowed in script\n\n\n3.1 Minding your parentheses\nIn script, everything goes left-to-right so you cannot write a fraction as you would in Algebra.  Instead, we need to be more explicit and put both both the numerator and the denominator in parentheses:\n\\[\nv=\\frac{\\left(d_{f}-d_{i}\\right)}{\\left(t_{f}-t_{i}\\right)}\n\\]\nThen, pull out the fraction between the numerator and denominator and replace it with a division sign:\n\\[\nv=\\left(d_{f}-d_{i}\\right) /\\left(t_{f}-t_{i}\\right)\n\\]\nNow the formula is all on one line, but the symbols need to be replaced with valid variable names that do not have subscripts:\n\\[\n\\text { velocity }=(\\text { finalDist }- \\text { initDist }) /(\\text { finalTime }- \\text { initTime })\n\\]\nThis is now a valid line of code in R – assuming all variables on the right have assigned values.\nvelocity = (finalDist - initDist) / (finalTime - initTime);\nThe line of code above says that velocity will be assigned the value equal to the calculations on the right side of the equation.\n\n\n3.2 Other ways to assign values\nIn most programming languages the equal sign is used to assign values, and the equal sign always evaluates what is on the right side and assigns it to the variable on the left.  In R, there are two other ways to assign values – using arrow signs:\n«velocity &lt;-» (finalDist - initDist) / (finalTime - initTime); # commonly used\n(finalDist - initDist) / (finalTime - initTime) «-&gt; velocity»; # rarely used\nThe top ( &lt;- ) is the most commonly used in R and the bottom ( -&gt; ) works but is rarely used anymore.  I prefer using ( = ) to ( &lt;- ) because ( = ) is used in most programming languages whereas ( &lt;- ) is not. \n \nNote: In this case, ( = ) and ( &lt;- ) are functionally the same. There are functional differences between the two when calling functions.\n\n\n3.3 Variable naming error\nHere is the full script with a small error on the line calculating velocity:\nrm(list=ls());          # clean out the environment\n\nfinalDistance = 100;\ninitDistance = 50;\n«finaltime» = 20;       # error on this line -- misspelled variable name\ninitTime = 15;\nvelocity = (finalDistance - initDistance) / (finalTime - initTime);\nEvery variable on the right side of the velocity equation must be given a value beforehand –  otherwise, you will get the pesky Object not found error as shown in the image below (Fig.##)\n \n&lt;image&gt;\nObject not found because the variable name does not exist (it is misspelled).\n \nNote: Object is almost synonymous with Variable in R.  The error is basically saying that there is no variable with that name.  Any spelling error will cause the Object not found error.  In this case I “spelled” the variable name wrong by changing the case of the T.  finaltime is not the same as finalTime.\n \nrm(list=ls());          # clean out the environment\nerrors\n \nfinalDistance = 100;\ninitDistance = 50;\n«finalTime» = 20;\ninitTime = 15;\nvelocity = (finalDistance - initDistance) / (finalTime - initTime);\n&lt;image&gt;\nMisspelled variable name corrected – script now calculates velocity.",

    "text": "4 Different types of variables\nVariables is a widely used term found in many different fields – however the definition of variable is not consistent.  For this reason, I will always modify the term variable with the typeof variable (e.g., algebraic variable, experimental variable, statistical variable) with the exception of a programming variable.  If you see the term variable without anything preceding it, then you can assume it refers to a programming variable.\n\n4.1 Algebraic variables\nIn Physics, we use algebraic variables to describe the relationship between physical properties.  For example, velocity can be expressed algebraically as  v=d/t where v, d, and t are symbols representing the physical properties of velocity, distance, and time.  The formula states that the relationship v=d/t is maintained even as the numbers change.\n \nIn this case, v, d, and t are all algebraic variables that have the following properties:\n\nName: v, d, t (name is synonymous with symbol)\nType: numeric (v, d, and t are all numbers)\nValue: given by situation – the value can be known or unknown\n\n\n\n4.2 Variables in porogramming\nIn programming, variables work in a similar way. Variables in programming are named storage locations in memory that hold information.\n \nThis information could be\n\na runner’s distance, time, and velocity\nthe number of fish caught in a day or the name of the lake the fish were caught in\nthe temperature, humidity, or wind speed\n\n \nLike algebraic variables, variables in programming have a name, type, and value.\n\n4.2.1 Name\nThe name corresponds to the symbol in our physics example above – it is how the variable is represented in the script.  The name is used to reference the storage location in memory that holds the information.  For our initial example, we will use the symbols (v,d,t) as the variable names.  Later in this lesson, I will talk about variable naming conventions.\n\n\n4.2.2 Value \nThe value is the information that is stored in the location pointed to by the name, so when v = 10 , that means there is a storage location in memory named v, and in that location, there is the number 10 (note: we will not worry about units).\nTrap: Constants in programming\n\n\n4.2.3 Type\nThe type describes what kind of value is being stored in memory which, in turn, tells R what kind of operations can be performed on the variable. Distance, velocity, and time all have numeric values, and mathematical operations can be performed on them.\n \nNumeric is one type of value a variable can have, some of the other types of values are:\n\nstrings (also called characters): a text value (e.g., a lake name)\ncategorical: a limited set of text values (e.g., the four seasons or the five Great Lakes)\nBoolean: a TRUE/FALSE statement\nDate: a date in day-month-year format\n\n \nWe will talk more about the non-numeric variable types in future lessons, for now, we will stick with numeric variables.",

Everything after the # does not get executed and is informational.\n \nLines 3 and 6 are full comment lines – again, they are there to make the script easier to understand.  You can take them out and the script will produce the same result.\n \nLines 4, 5, and 7 are where the real action occurs and each line contains a variable assignment:\n\nLine 4 assigns the value 100 to the variable named d\nLine 5 assigns the value 20 to the variable named t\nLine 7 assigns the value of the calculation d/t to the variable named v.\n\n \nLines 1, 4, 5, and 7 all have semicolons ( ; ) at the end.  The semicolon designates the end of a programming command just like the period designates the end of a sentence.  The semicolon is optional in R and is often not used, but I highly recommend the use of semicolons in all of your scripts – they make code easier to debug, help you think about the flow of your code, and are required in most programming languages.\n \nTrap: Assignment vs. Equality Operations\nExtension: alternate assignment operator\n\n\n5.4 Execute your code – the Environment tab\nClick Source to execute your R code ( Figure 3 ).  Your RStudio window should look similar to this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Executing (sourcing) the velocity-distance-time script\n\n\n\nNotice that the Environment tab displays the values for the variables v, d, and t. The Environment tab displays every variable that is in your script and is a very useful tool for both debugging and viewing the results of your script.\n \nTry changing the values for d and t (lines 7 and 8) and click Source again to see how the values in the Environment tab change.",

This causes all sorts of problems when script file look for other files.  The way to get around this is to set the Working Directories using setwd().  This is a mess because Working Directories change when file are moved between computers or even within a computer.  Scripts that set working directories are much harder to share and maintain.  This author strongly suggests that you use RStudio Projects and avoid the working directory mess.",

    "text": "3 Vector Variables\nVector variables, or vector for short, are variables that hold multiple related values.  For instance if we have temperature values for 5 days, we could create 5 variables and assign each one a temperature value:\ntempHigh1 = 65;\ntempHigh2 = 57;\ntempHigh3 = 61;\ntempHigh4 = 64;\ntempHigh5 = 59;\nAnd, in the last lesson’s application, we averaged the 5 values like this:\ntempAvg = (tempHigh1 + tempHigh2 + tempHigh3 +\n           tempHigh4 + tempHigh5) / 5;\n\n3.1 Grouping values\nBut, in programming we want to group related values together.  So, instead of creating 5 different variables, we create one vector that has 5 values:\ntempHigh = c(65, 57, 61, 64, 59);\nOne of the main reasons to create a vector is that the values in the vector are all associated and we can perform mathematical operations on the whole vector.  For instance, we might have temperatures in Fahrenheit and want to convert all the temperature to Celsius:\ntempHighCel = (5/9) * (tempHigh - 32)\nOr, we can use one of R’s many, many statistical functions, mean(), on the vector:\ntempMean = mean(tempHigh); \nWe can see in the Environment that tempHighCel has 5 converted temperatures and that tempMean is the same as tempAvg above:\ntempAvg:     61.2\ntempHigh:    num [1:5] 65 57 61 64 59\ntempHighCel: num [1:5] 18.3 139 16.1 17.5 15\ntempMean:    61.2\nExtension: Statistical functions on vectors\n\n\n3.2 Indexing values in a vector\nPutting values into vectors also allows us to associated values between vectors.  If we have a vector of high temperature values, then we could also have a vector of low temperature values.\ntempLow = c(45, 40, 55, 37, 42);\nWe can directly subtract tempLow values from tempHigh to get the difference in temperature for all values:\ntempDiff = tempHigh - tempLow;\nWe can index individual values.  You could think of the vector as 5 days.  And if you want, you can find the change in temperature for any day using the index 1 through 5:\ntempDiff_3 = tempHigh[3] - tempLow[3];\ntempDiff_5 = tempHigh[5] - tempLow[5];\nThe Environment shows:\ntempHigh:   num [1:5] 65 57 61 64 59\ntempLow:    num [1:5] 45 40 55 37 42\ntempDiff:   num [1:5] 20 17 6 27 17\ntempDiff_3: 6\ntempDiff_5: 17\n\n\n3.3 Vectors and columns in a data frame\nData frames are essentially made up of vectorsthat all have the same length.  The vectors are the columns in the data frame and the number of values in the vector is determined by the number of rows in the data frame.  In Fig.## there is a weather data frame (that we will use in later lessons) and each column has a measured daily weather value (e.g., minTemp, maxTemp).  The row gives all the measured weather values for a specific day (e.g., row 1 is Jan 1, row 2 is Jan 2).\n&lt;image&gt;\nA data frame viewed in RStudio with 23 variables (i.e., the 23 columns, which are vector variables)",

    "text": "4 CSV files\nIn the first couple of lessons we were using data from inside the script but most of the data you will use will come from outside the script – often from a data frame. The data frames themselves often come from a CSV file. CSV stands for Comma Separated Values, meaning that the values in the file are separated by commas.\n \nNote: CSV is really just a text file that can be read in any text editor and CSV file do not have to use commas as separators.\n \nLet’s look at a small data set we downloaded in the Files for this lesson section called twoWeekWeatherData.csv, which contains two weeks of weather data from Lansing, Michigan. \n\n4.1 Opening a CSV file\nCSV files are often opened by default in Excel and this can problematic:\n\nTrap: Opening CSV files in Excel\n\nCSV files are just text files and CSV files can be opened in any text editor (e.g., notepad, notepad++, textEdit).\n \nRStudio is a text editor so we can open  twoWeekWeatherData.csv in RStudio by either:\n\nClicking File -&gt; Open File… and navigate to twoWeekWeatherData.csv and press OK.\nUsing the Files tab: go to your data folder, click on twoWeekWeatherData.csv, choose View File (fig.##)\n\n&lt;image&gt;\nThe twoWeekWeatherData.csv file opened in RStudio\n \nThe CSV file has 15 lines (rows).  The first row contains the 5 column headers and the other 14 rows contain the 5 values for each date – all separated by a comma.\n\n\n4.2 Reading in a CSV file\nWe can see that the CSV file has a header row and each row has five values representing: date, highTemp, lowTemp, precipitation, noonCondition.\n \nTo use the data in a script we need to read the data into a script file – and for that we will use the read.csv() function.\nrm(list=ls()); # cleans out the Environment \n\nweatherData = read.csv(file=\"data/twoWeekWeatherData.csv\", # path to file\n                       sep=\",\",                   # values are separated by commas\n                       header=TRUE);               # there is a header row\nread.csv() reads in the data from the CSV file – and saves the data to a variable called weatherData.\n \nweatherData is a data frame variable and it appears in the Environment tab under Data as 14 obs. of 5 variables. (i.e., 14 rows and 5 columns), which matches what we saw in the CSV file (Fig.##). \n\nDouble-clicking on weatherData opens the data frame in the File Viewer window.  This is a convenient way to visualize the data frame.\nClicking on the blue arrow to the left of weatherData provides information about each of the columns\n\n&lt;image&gt;\nViewing the data frame in the File Viewer\n\n\n4.3 Column value type\nIn the Environment, when you click on the arrow next to the left of weatherData you see some information about the columns in the data frame. The first piece of information is the name of the column (i.e., the header – date, highTemp, etc.).  The second is the type of value the column contains.\n \nIn weatherData there are three types of values:\n\nint (e.g., highTemp and lowTemp): integer – or non-decimal numbers\nnum (e.g., precipitation): numeric, or numbers with decimals\nchr: (e.g, noonCoondition) this stands for character, and character is really short for string of characters, and this in turn is typically shortened to string.  Whatever you call it, it is the catch-all category for values R cannot recognize as anything else. \n\n \nNote: the date column has date values but it is not formatted properly so R does not recognize it as a Date – something we will cover later.",

A function is a set of code separate from your main script that performs a common task (e.g., plotting values, finding a standard deviation, reading in a file).\n \nThere is a lot going on in our first line of code and that is because there are a lot of options, called arguments, when opening up a CSV file!  We will talk a little bit about these arguments here and save the rest of the discussion for the next lesson.\n \nInside the function read.csv(), I included four arguments (file, sep, header, and stringsAsFactors).  Arguments are like the knobs and dials for a function.  The function reads in a CSV file and the arguments tweak how the file is read.\n\n5.1 file\nfile = “data/twoWeekWeatherData.csv” means that the script opens the file called twoWeekWeatherData.csv located in the data folder of your RStudio Project\n \nThis only works if you are in the RStudio Project because the RStudio Project sets the Working Directory to your Project Folder.\n \nIf you execute the script file outside your RStudio Project, you will get a cannot open file error because the script does not know where to start looking for the CSV file.\n&lt;image&gt;\nYou get a cannot open file error if you try to execute the script outside of your RStudio Project\n\n\n5.2 sep\nsep = “,” means that the values in the file are separated by commas.  This is not always true – even for CSV files.\n \nThe most common alternate separator values are spaces ( sep = ” “ ) and dots ( sep = “.” )\n\n\n5.3 header\nheader = TRUE means the first row contains header information. In this case the header information is the column names (date, highTemp, lowTemp, and precipitation)\n \nheader=FALSE would mean that the first row contains data (i.e., there are no column names).  If you set header=FALSE in this example then R will think that the column names are the first data point.  So, you will have 15 values in each vector and the first value will not make sense.",

    "text": "10 Extension: Long and Short Integers\nL stands for Long integer – long meaning that this variable can hold a number larger than 256.  In the old days, when space on computers was VERY expensive, programmers would save space by having a short integer and long integer designation.  So, if a programmer knew a number was small, they would assign it to a short integer to take up less space on the computer.  Since temperatures in Lansing are generally going to be less than 256 (unless you are using the Kelvin system), it is safe to assign temperatures to short integers.\n \nNowadays, space is so cheap that we rarely care that we are using a tiny bit more memory than we need – so L has become mostly a relic of the past.",

    "text": "3 Run vs. Source\nThe Source button is used to execute the whole script (i.e., every command in the script) while the Run button is used to selectively execute commands.  Run is a great tool for debugging and testing your code and we are going to almost exclusively use Run for the next two lessons.\n \nThe next two lessons are more about showing off features in R and RStudio and not about creating a full script.  However, your goal with most scripts is to be able to execute the file using Source.  It takes longer to develop you script using Source but it forces you to automate your script which makes your script both easier to debug and share.\n\n3.1 Executing one line\nWe already have an example of using Run to execute one line in Figure 1.  When we put the cursor on line 6 and clicked Run, R executed the cat() command on line 6.  We will talk much more about cat() next lesson but cat() outputs to the Console whatever is in the parentheses.\n \nActually, clicking Run does not just execute the line, but everything associate with the command on the line.  When you look at the Console output, you see that lines 5 and 6 were both executed – but line 5 was just a comment line so it does not do anything.\n\n\n\n&gt;   ### Output a text message  \n&gt;   cat(\"Hello\");             \nHello                          \n\n\nFigure 2: Lines in Console that start with a ( &gt; ) are command lines\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Executing multiple commands on one line\nYou can put as many command as you want on one line as long as use semicolons between them.\n \nThe following line has three commands that\n\ncreate two variables (a and b)\noutput the addition of them to the Console. \n\na=3; b=7; cat(\"a+b=\", a+b);\nClicking Run on the line will add a and b to the Environment:\na   3\nb   7\nAnd the addition of a and b is displayed in the Console:\n&gt;   ### Multiple commands on one line\n&gt;   a=3; b=7; cat(\"a+b=\", a+b);\na+b= 10\nIf you remove the semicolons then you will get the error: unexpected symbol in ”  a=3 b”\nBasically, R is saying the it does not understand what the symbol b means because R thinks that b is still part of the a=3 command.\n\n\n3.3 Executing highlighted script\nYou can also highlight parts of your script and Run will executed exactly what is highlighted.\n \nIf you highlight lines 12, 13, and 14:\n  cat(\"Hello, World.\\n\");\n  cat(\"How are you?\\n\");\n  cat(\"I am fine?\\n\");\nand click Run, the output to the Console is:\n\n\n\n&gt;   cat(\"Hello, World.\\n\");\nHello, World.\n&gt;   cat(\"How are you?\\n\");\nHow are you?\n&gt;   cat(\"I am fine?\\n\");\nI am fine?\n\n\nFigure 3: Three commands sent to Console by clicking Run\n\n\n\nRemember, when you highlight code,Run will execute exactly what you highlight.  In other words, R executes verbatim what you highlight.  So, if you accidentally highlight a bit of line 11 along with lines 12-13:\n  ### Outputting multiple text messages «(\\n means go to next line)»\n  «cat(\"Hello, World.\\n\");»\n  «cat(\"How are you?\\n\");»\n  «cat(\"I am fine?\\n\");»\nThen in the Console you will get the error:\n&gt; (\\n means go to next line)\nError: unexpected symbol in \"(\\n\"\nR is trying to execute the last part of line 11 and it does not know it is part of a comment because you did not highlight the ### part of the line, which would have told R that this line is a comment.\n\n\n3.4 Executing one command on multiple lines\nLines 17-20 contain the command to open the twoWeekWeatherData.csv file and save the data to a data frame named weatherData.\n  ### read in data from  twoWeekWeatherData.csv\n  weatherData = read.csv(file=\"data/twoWeekWeatherData.csv\", \n                         sep=\",\",\n                         header=TRUE, \n                         stringsAsFactors = FALSE);\nIf we put the cursor on any line from 17 to 20 and click Run, R will execute all 4 lines.  When you click Run, R will execute whatever command the cursor is in the middle of.  In this case, the command starts on line 17 and ends on line 20.\n \nWhen we Run line 17, the Console output shows lines 16-20 (16 is a comment) were executed – the ( + ) at the beginning of the lines in the Console says that this line is a continuation of the command from the previous line.\n\n\n\n&gt;   ### read in data from  twoWeekWeatherData.csv\n&gt;   weatherData = read.csv(file=\"data/twoWeekWeatherData.csv\", \n«+»                         sep=\",\",\n«+»                          header=TRUE, \n«+»                          stringsAsFactors = FALSE);  \n\n\nFigure 4: Console output when executing the multi-line command to open the csv file\n\n\n\nExecuting lines 16-20 means that you have a new variable named weatherData and this variable is put in the Environment tab:\n\n\n\nweatherData   14 obs. of 5 variables\n\n\nFigure 5: The Environment tab after the read.csv() command was executed",
