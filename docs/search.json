    "text": "5 Creating your own functions\nYou can create your own function to perform a task that you do multiple times, and this function can be used in any of your scripts.  It is best to put functions in a script of their own because they should be designed to operate independently.  Putting functions in a separate script also helps reinforce the independence of functions from the rest of script.\n \nWe will start be creating a new script file called termperature.r and save it to the script folder.  temperature.r.\n\n5.1 Categorizing temperatures using a function\nWe will start off simply and have our first function, tempCategory(), take one value as an argument and give a category for the temperature (e.g., hot, warm, cold).  This argument will be called tempValue.  tempValue could be given a default value (e.g., tempValue = 50), but this probably does not make sense because there are too many values the caller could use (and infinitely many if you include decimals).\ntempCategory = function(tempValue)  # there is no default value for tempValue\n{\n  # like if-else statements and for loops, the curly brackets create a codeblock\n  # attached to the function -- and all code inside the function gets indented\n}\nNext we add in a if-else-if structure to categorize the temperature value:\n\nfreezing (1-20 degrees)\ncold (21-40 degrees)\nmoderate (41-60 degrees)\nwarm (61-80 degrees)\nhot (81-100 degrees)\n\n \nAnd for each if-else-if statement, we will return the temperature category.\ntempCategory = function(tempValue)\n{\n  if(tempValue &gt;= 1 & tempValue &lt;= 20)\n  {\n    return(\"freezing\");\n  }\n  else if(tempValue &gt;= 21 & tempValue &lt;= 40)\n  {\n    return(\"cold\");\n  }\n  else if(tempValue &gt;= 41 & tempValue &lt;= 60)\n  {\n    return(\"moderate\");\n  }\n  else if(tempValue &gt;= 61 & tempValue &lt;= 80)\n  {\n    return(\"warm\");\n  }\n  else if(tempValue &gt;= 81 & tempValue &lt;= 100)\n  {\n    return(\"hot\");\n  }\n}\n\n\n5.2 Getting functions into a script\ntempCategory() exists in the script temperature.r in the scripts folder of you project.  tempCategory() can be used in any script file in your project by including the line:\nsource(file=\"scripts/temperature.r\");\nThe line above reads all the functions inside temperature.r and puts them into the Environment so that the rest of the script can use the functions inside temperature.r.\ntempCategory:   function (tempValue)\n\n\n5.3 Calling functions\nNow we can call tempCategory().\n \nThe argument tempValue is a variable that is set by the caller and used by the function tempCategory().  Here we test out 4 different calls to tempCategory() – each setting tempValue to a value:\ncat1a = tempCategory(45);\ncat1b = tempCategory(tempValue=85);\ncat1c = tempCategory(tempValue=17);\ncat1d = tempCategory(-2); \ncat1a:   \"moderate\"\ncat1b:   \"hot\"\ncat1c:   \"freezing\"\ncat1d:   NULL\nWhen -2 is the argument, NULL is the return value.  The function does not handle negative values so nothing, or NULL, was returned.\n\nNote: In programming, NULL is an empty object whereas NA is an empty or nonexistent value.\n\n\n5.4 Return values\nFunctions, in many ways, are designed to answer a question from the caller.  The answer comes in the form of a return value given by return().  It is up to the caller to determine how to use the return value.   When the following line of code is executed:\ncat1b = tempCategory(tempValue=85);\ntempCategory() is called with the argument tempValue set to 85.  The code inside tempCategory() is executed and the value “hot” is returned.  The variable cat1b is set to the return value, “hot”.",

\ncat5a:   \"moderate\"\ncat5b:   \"hot\"\ncat5c:   \"freezing\"\ncat5d:   NULL\nAnd next test tempCategory5() with vectors that we create using c() and seq():\ncat5e = tempCategory5(c(10,30,50,70,90));\ncat5f = tempCategory5(seq(from=5, to=90, by=20));\ncat5g = tempCategory5(tempVector=c(30,25,20,15,10), unit=\"C\");\ncat5h = tempCategory5(tempVector=seq(from=25, to=-5, by=-5), unit=\"C\");\ncat5e = tempCategory5(c(10,30,50,70,90));\ncat5f = tempCategory5(seq(from=5, to=90, by=20));\ncat5g = tempCategory5(tempVector=c(30,25,20,15,10), unit=\"C\");\ncat5h = tempCategory5(tempVector=seq(from=25, to=-5, by=-5), unit=\"C\");\nAnd, lastly, test tempCategory5() with vectors from a data frame.  For this we will use the Lansing weather data for the year 2016 and use the maxTemp and minTemp columns:\nweatherData = read.csv(file=\"data/LansingNOAA2016.csv\", \n                       sep=\",\",\n                       header=TRUE, \n                       stringsAsFactors = FALSE); \n\ncat5i = tempCategory5(weatherData$maxTemp);\ncat5j = tempCategory5(weatherData$minTemp);\n\n\n8.5 Saving vectors to a data frame\nThe Environment says that there are 366 values inside cat5i and cat5j, but it would be easier to see the values in context – by adding the vectors to the weatherData data frame.\n  weatherData$maxTempCat = cat5i;\n  weatherData$minTempCat = cat5j;\nWhen you double-click on weatherData in the Environment, you will see the new columns at the end (maxTempCat and minTempCat).  The view in Figure 2 is days at the beginning of the year – so, January and it’s cold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Adding the temperature vectors to the weatherData data frame\n\n\n\n \nExtension: Creating a factor (categorical) vector",

For instance, we might want to repeat a conversion on various values across columns from multiple dataframes.  Function are self-contained codeblocks that can be called from any script.\n \nThere are many functions built into R and far more in the many packages in R.  You can also create your own functions.  We are going to start with some statistical functions built into R.\n\n3.1 Statistical function\nR was designed as a programming language for statistics so it is no surprise that R has a lot of statistical function.  We will look at the most basic functions: mean(), max(), median(), min(), and sd().\n \nAll of these functions:\n\nTake a vector of numeric values as input.  Note: these functions can, technically, take one value (i.e., a vector of 1) as input, but the results would be boring.\nApply some operations to these values – these operations are done behind-the-scenes\nReturn the answer\n\n \nLet’s use four of R’s statistical functions on the precipitation column in weatherData:\nweatherData = read.csv(file=\"data/twoWeekWeatherData3.csv\", \n                       sep=\",\",\n                       header=TRUE, \n                       stringsAsFactors = FALSE);  \n  \nprecip = weatherData$precipitation;\n\nprecipMean = mean(precipitation);\nprecipMax = max(precipitation);\nprecipMed = median(precipitation);\nprecipVar = sd(precipitation);\nThe results of these function calls in the Environment:\nprecipMax:    1.13\nprecipMean:   0.2617\nprecipMed     0.025\nprecipSD      0.4018",

    "text": "8 Finding the highest (or lowest) value\nFor the last example we are going to find the highest temperature in a vector.  We do this by cycling though each value in the vector highTemps and comparing it to the current highest temperature.  If the new value is higher than the highest temperature, then we set that to be the highest temperature.\n \nHere is the code – we will go over it in more detail in a bit:\n\n\n\nhighestTemp = 0;  # initialize the state variable to 0\n\nfor (i in 1:numDays)\n{\n  if(highTemps[i] &gt; highestTemp) # is this day's value grater than the current high\n  {\n    # this day's value is higher -- set highestTemp to this value\n    highestTemp = highTemps[i]; \n    # browser();  # uncomment to pause the script's execution at this point\n  }\n}\n\n\nFigure 6: Finding the highest value in a vector\n\n\n\n\n8.1 Using browser() to pause your script\nThe for loop above is going through every value in the highTemps in order.  Each time a new high temperature is found, highestTemp is set top that value.  So, highestTemp is going to start at 0 (the initial value), and change multiple times.\n \nIf we put highTemps in the Console, we can see each time a new highest temperature will occur:\n&gt; highTemps\n [1] «57» 50 54 40 39 «58» «60» 53 55 44 39 54 «61» «75»\nA new highest temperature will be discovered 5 times: 57, 58, 60, 61, and 75 (cycles 1, 6 , 7, 13, and 14).\n \nWe can use browser() to see this, too.  browser() is an instruction to pause the script in the middle of execution and put it in debug mode.\n \nIf we uncomment the browser() line in Figure 6:\n   # browser();  # uncomment to pause the script's execution at this point\nThen the script will pause at that line when the condition if(highestTemp &gt; highTemps[i]) is TRUE, which happens 5 times (out of 14 cycles) when i = 1, 6, 7, 13, and 14.\n \nbrowser() will initially pause the script when i = 1 and you can click Continue to pause the script when i = 6, 7, 13, and 14.  For now, the only other button you should know is Stop, which ends debug mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: The script Sourced with browser() uncommented after Continue is clicked twice\n\n\n\n \nDebug mode is a complicated topic that will be more fully explored in a future lesson.\n\n\n8.2 Initializing the state variable\nI initialized the state variable, highestTemp, to 0 – and that works in this case because we know there are temperatures greater than 0.  But, if all the temperatures were negative, then this would not work (I will let you answer why this would not work in the Application).\n \nA better solution is to set the state variable to the first value in the vector (highTemps[1]).  This makes the first value in the highTemps vector the default answer.  In other words, if every condition check is FALSE (i.e., no temperature is greater than the first) then the first temperature is the highest temperature.\n \nNote: this means you could start the indexing variable i at 2 instead of one.  You do not need to test the 1st value against the 1st value – there is no harm but it is a tiny bit inefficient.\n\n\n\nhighestTemp2 = highTemps[1];  # set the state variable to the first value in the vector\n\nfor(i in 1:numDays) # could be (i in 2:numDays)\n{\n  if(highTemps[i] &gt; highestTemp2) # is this day's value greater than the current high\n  {\n    highestTemp2 = highTemps[i];  # set the state variable to the current day's value\n  }\n}\n\n\nFigure 8: Using a for loop to find the highest value in a vector\n\n\n\nWhenever you are looking for the most extreme value in a vector, it is best to set the state variable to the first value in the vector.  By doing this, you do not have to guess what kind of values you are going to get.",

    "text": "3 Dealing with FALSE conditions\nIn the last lesson we looked at execution of the if() statement and how it changes the flow of a script.  The code is conditionally executed based on a conditional statement inside the parenthesis of the if().  The codeblock attached to the if() using curly brackets  ( { } ) was executed only if the conditional statement is TRUE. \nrandomNum = sample(1:100, size=1);\n\nif(randomNum &gt; 50)  # execute the attached codeblock if TRUE\n{\n  cat(\"You win\");\n}\n\n3.1 Else and FALSE conditions\nMany times when you are programming you want to execute something when the condition (e.g., temperature &gt; 50) is TRUE and when the condition is FALSE.  You execute a codeblock on a FALSE condition by using an if-else statement.\n\n\n\nrandomNum2 = sample(1:100, size=1);\n\nif(randomNum2 &gt; 50)  # execute the attached codeblock if TRUE\n{\n  cat(\"You win\");\n}\nelse # execute this codeblock if FALSE\n{\n  cat(\"You lose\");\n}\n\n\nFigure 1: This author’s preference for structuring an if-else statement\n\n\n\n\nIf the condition is TRUE, the codeblock in the curly brackets ( {  } ) attached to the if() gets executed.\nIf the condition is FALSE, the codeblock in the curly brackets attached to the else gets executed.\n\n \nNote: Like if() statements, if-else statements are often used within for loops to check multiple values at once (e.g., all values in a column of a data frame) – we will be getting to that in the next lesson.\n\n\n3.2 Alternate bracket placement\nThe curly bracket placement in Figure 1 is my preference and is a programming standard.  The following curly bracket placement is also considered a programming standard and can also be used for this class:\n\n\n\nif(randomNum2 &gt; 50) { \n  cat(\"You win\");\n}\nelse {\n  cat(\"You lose\");\n}\n\n\nFigure 2: An alternate method for structuring an if-else statement\n\n\n\nExtension: Skipping brackets in if-else structures\n\n\n3.3 Curly bracket in R and a bug\nHowever, when you see an R script you often see people write their if-else statements like this:\n\n\n\nif(randomNum2 &gt; 50) { \n  cat(\"You win\");\n} else { \n  cat(\"You lose\");\n}\n\n\nFigure 3: The common way in R to structure an if-else statement\n\n\n\nThis is not a standard programming practice and the reason you often see it written this way has to do with a bug in R that can cause an unexpected else error if the brackets are placed as they are in Figure 1 or Figure 2 .\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Unexpected else error that occurs when if-else statements are structured using the standard programming method\n\n\n\nOne fix is to use the standard R way of placing brackets in if-else statements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The usual placement of brackets for if-else statements in R\n\n\n\nHowever, you can use the standard method for placing curly brackets as long as the if-else statement is encapsulated within another set of curly brackets.  This is the reason I put curly brackets at the beginning and end of my script – it allows the use of standard curly bracket placement for if-else statements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Putting curly brackets around the whole script also fixes the error.\n\n\n\nRun will still not work on lines 7-14 because Run does not see the curly brackets at the beginning and end.",

In fact,“E” will be part of the output no matter what you type in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Putting a condition on an else – causes an error\n\n\n\nEssentially, you have detached the codeblock\n{                 \n   cat(\"E\");\n}\nfrom the else statement and, because of this, cat(“E”) will execute every time the script is executed.\n \nThe proper way to code the else is as follows:\nrm(list=ls());   options(show.error.locations = TRUE);\n \nscore = readline(\"Enter your score: \");\nscore = as.numeric(score);\n \nif(score &gt; 90) \n{\n   cat(\"A\");\n}\nelse if(score &gt; 80) # score between 80-90\n{\n   cat(\"B\");\n}\nelse if(score &gt; 70) # score between 70-80\n{ \n   cat(\"C\");\n}\nelse if(score &gt; 60) # score between 60-70\n{ \n   cat(\"D\");\n}\nelse  # all other conditions failed\n{                 \n   cat(\"E\")\n}\nNow the else will execute only when all other conditions fail.  In other words, it will execute when score is less than or equal to 60",

    "section": "2 Output to console",
    "text": "2 Output to console\nThe Console tab has many uses and one of them is to output messages from a script – the messages can contain text, variable, or some combination of the two.  Outputting messages to the Console can be done using the function cat(), which stands for concatenate. This is R’s way of saying that cat() will concatenate (combine) variables and values to create an output.\n \nExtension: cat() vs print()\n\n2.1 Output a message\nWe will first use cat() to output a text message to the Console tab – to do this we need to put the message in quotes:\ncat(\"Hello\");\n\n\n\nHello\n\n\nFigure 1: Outputting a text message in the Console tab\n\n\n\nIf you do not use quotes (” “), R will think you are referring to a variable.  For instance, the line cat(Hello) gives you the Object not found error because R thinks this is a reference to a variable named Hello – and, in this case, there is no variable named Hello. \ncat(Hello); # Will cause an «object not found» error\n\n\n\nError in cat(Hello) : object Hello not found\n\n\nFigure 2: An error that occurs if you try to output a variable (object) that does not exist in your script.\n\n\n\nNote: If there is a variable named Hello in your script, then cat(Hello); will output the value of the variable Hello.\n\n\n2.2 Output multiple messages\nYou can add as many cat() statements to your script as you like and they will be displayed sequentially in the Console tab:\ncat(\"Hello, World.\");\ncat(\"How are you?\");\ncat(\"I am fine.\");\n\n\n\nHello World. How are you? I am fine.\n\n\nFigure 3: Output message without spacing\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 The line feed: \\n\nBut there is a problem here – R puts no spacing in between the lines (Figure 3).  This is typical behavior of programming languages – they do not add line feeds (e.g., enter or return) unless the script specifically requests that a line feed is added.\n \nThe instruction to add a line feed is to put \\n inside the quotes ( “  ” ):\ncat(\"Hello, World.\\n\");\ncat(\"How are you?\\n\");\ncat(\"I am\\n fine.\\n\"); # the first \\n will break up the line\n\n\n\nHello, World\nHow are you?\nI am\n fine.\n\n\nFigure 4: Message with line feeds\n\n\n\nIn Figure 4 we have our text on multiple lines.  Notice that the \\n does not get printed to the screen.  \\n is an instruction to R to add a line feed, sometimes called a newline character, and \\n needs to be put inside the quotes.\n \n\\n can be put anywhere in a quote.  In the above code there is a \\n put in between “am” and “fine”, hence the line feed between the two words.  The exact same message as Figure 4 can be output to the Console tab using only one cat() statement with multiple \\n:\ncat(\"Hello, World.\\nHow are you?\\nI am\\n fine?\\n\");\n\n\n\nHello, World\nHow are you?\nI am\n fine.\n\n\nFigure 5: Using one cat() statement with multiple \\n to output multiple lines of text",

    "text": "3 Escape character: backslash ( \\ )\nThe backslash in programming is used in a string as an escape character. An escape character tells R that the next character is to be treated as a command rather than the character. This is similar to the way the Shift, Control, or Alt keys on your keyboard change the meaning of the character that is pressed with them (e.g, control-C is a command to copy).\n \nBackslash can be used to\n\nput in a control like a line feed ( \\n ) or a tab ( \\t )\nprint a character that has a functional meaning like a double quote ( \\“ ). In other words, treat the double quote as a character for output, not as the start or end of a string. This also works if you want to output a backslash ( \\\\ )\nuse Unicode to print our characters not on the keyboard using Unicode.  Here is a link to a partial list of Unicode characters.  Use the Escape sequence given on the page.  Note: according to Wikipedia, there are around 150,000 Unicode characters – and just recently Unicode has added lots of emojis.\n\n \ncat(\"\\tAnd the boy said, \\\"Hello\\\" \\n\");\ncat(\"Send a backslash \\\\ to the Console\\n\")\ncat(\"Some Unicode characters: \\u00C5 \\u0A94 \\u0115\\n\");\n\n\n\n    And the boy said, \"Hello\" \nSend a backslash \\ to the Console\nSome Unicode characters: Å ઔ ĕ\n\n\nFigure 6: Using backslash ( \\ ) to output special characters.",

These all have default values (e.g., file=““, sep=” “)\n\n7.1 The sep argument\nArguments are used to modify the behavior of a function.  sep changes how the different components of the output are separated– the default is to use 1 space.  We are going to change the sep argument.\n \nLet’s take the code from above and add the sep argument to cat() and give sep the value ” ** “:\n  cat(\"Day 5-9 temperature:\", lowTemps[5:9], \"\\n\", \n      \"Temp on odd days:\", lowTemps[seq(from=1, by=2, to=10)], \"\\n\",\n      sep = \" ** \");\nAnd you will notice that the different components in cat() are separated by ” ** “.\n\n\n\nDay 5-9 temperature: ** 36 ** 45 ** 32 ** 50 ** 48 ** \n ** Temp on odd days: ** 45 ** 46 ** 36 ** 32 ** 48 ** \n\n\nFigure 14: Using the sep argument in cat()\n\n\n\nNote: The most common way people use sep is to set sep=““– in other words, set sep to nothing so nothing is added to the output.\n \nTrap: Misplacing (or forgetting) quotes\n\n\n7.2 The file argument\nBy default, cat() will output to the Console.

    "section": "4 A simpler function: median()",
    "text": "4 A simpler function: median()\nLet’s take a step back and look at a simpler function, median(), which takes a vector and finds the median value in the vector.\n \nTo use median() we need a vector with numeric values in it, which we will call vec1:\nvec1 = c(3,4,5,6,21,45,61);\nAnd then we pass vec1 in as an argument to the median() function:\nmedianVal1 = median(vec1);\nTrap: Forgetting to pass in a vector to median\n \nAnd the Environment shows the return value, saved to medianVal1, is 6\nmedianVal1:   6\n\n4.1 Help for median()\nNow let’s use RStudio’s Help tab to go behind-the-scenes of median().  RStudio Help tab is a useful resource for finding out more information on functions. The information that appears in Help is from the latest R documentation. If you do an internet search, you will often get older documentation. Note: the Help window is using the website https://search.r-project.org/.\n \nIf we type median in the search bar we get this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The median function in the Help tab in RStudio\n\n\n\n \nThe Help page shows that median() has two arguments:\n\nx: the vector that you want to find the median for\nna.rm: a TRUE/FALSE value that determines how to handle NA values in the vector. NA means Not Available and usually indicating a problem with the data\n\n \nNote: the ( … ) can be ignored – it is R indicating that this function can be expanded with more arguments\n\n\n4.2 Skipping argument names\nWhen we called median(), we did not include any argument names:\nmedianVal1 = median(vec1);\nHowever, since x is the first argument in median(), it is assumed that the first value is meant to be for x.\n \nThis is an equivalent call to median() that more explicitly says that the vec1 is the value for x:\nmedianVal1b = median(x=vec1);\nAnd the return value will be the same:\nmedianVal1:   6\nmedianVal1b:  6\n\n\n4.3 Default argument values\nThe other argument in median(), na.rm, has a default value of FALSE . This means that you do not have to supply a value for the argument na.rm when you call the function.  You only need to supply a value if you want to change na.rm to something other than FALSE (e.g., TRUE).\n \nOur first example did not have an NA values, let’s create a vector with an NA value in it:\nvec2 = c(3,4,5,NA,6,21,45,61);\nAnd then use that as an argument for median():\nmedianVal2 = median(x=vec2);\nIf there is an NA value in a vector then, for most mathenatical functions in R, the return value will be of type NA. The median of a vector with NA values will always be NA_real_. NA_real_ says that median cannot be determined but would be a real number.\nmedianVal2:   NA_real_\n\n\n4.4 Dealing with the NA\nna.rm is the argument that determines whether NA values are removed from the vector – and the default value is FALSE, meaning NA values are not removed.\n \nLet’s set na.rm to TRUE so the NA values are removed before finding the median:\nmedianVal2b = median(x=vec2, na.rm=TRUE);\nNow the NA in the vector is ignored and we get the same median value as before:\nmedianVal2b:   6\n\n\n4.5 Alternate ways to call median()\nArgument names (e.g., x and na.rm) are not needed if you put values in the correct order. All of these calls functionally do the same thing as the above median() call:\nmedianVal2c = median(vec2, TRUE);\nmedianVal2d = median(vec2, na.rm=TRUE);\nmedianVal2e = median(na.rm=TRUE, x=vec2);  # can reverse arguments if you name them\nmedianVal2f = median(x=vec2, TRUE);\nMy general recommendation is to always use argument names when calling a function.  This makes your code easier to read and you don’t have to worry about the order of the arguments.  This is especially important when you are dealing with more complicated functions that have lots of arguments (e.g., plotting functions).",

The other object types you might see are S4, RC (very rare), and R6.\n\n5.1 The arguments and defaults\nseq() has 5 arguments: from, to, by, length.out, and along.with.  We are going to ignore along.with, which complicates matters and is not needed, nor very useful.\n \nThe descriptions of the arguments in Figure 3 are helpful but the default argument values for seq() are misinformative:\n## Default S3 method\nseq(from = 1, to = 1, by = ((to - from)/(length.out - 1)),\n    length.out = NULL, along.with = NULL, ...)\nseq() essentially is solving for this equation:\n\\[\nby=\\frac{\\text{ to }-\\text{ from }}{\\text{ length.out }-1}\n\\]\nThere are four variables in the equation and you have to give exactly three out of four of them as arguments.  seq() will rearrange the formula, calculate the unknown fourth variable, and create the sequence.\n\n\n5.2 seq() examples\nIf you set from, to, and by as we did for seq1, seq() will calculate length.out (the number of values in the sequence)\nseq1 = seq(from=1, to=10, by=3);   # will have 4 values\nand give you the sequence:\nseq1: num[1:5] 1 4 7 10\nlength.out allows you to set the number of values in the sequence.  You can also set length.out to a value, but then you can only use 2 of these 3 arguments: from, to, and by.\n \nAn example of using length.out:\nseq2 = seq(from=1, to=10, length.out=5);\nThen you get 5 evenly spaced number starting with 1 and ending with 10\nseq2:   num[1:5] 1 3.25 5.5 7.75 10",

    "text": "6 read.csv() expanded\nWhen you go to the Help page for read.csv() , you are taken to the Help page for read.table(). This is because read.csv() is a version of the function read.table().  In other words, read.csv() is read.table() with different default values for the arguments. The different argument values are underlined in Figure 4.\n \nFor instance, the default value for sep (the separator between data) is a space in read.table() and a comma in read.csv().  read.csv() uses all the arguments from read.table() (e.g., row.names, col.names), read.csv() just changes some of the values for default arguments (underlined below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Using the Help tab in RStudio to look up functions (and a remainder that arguments are sometimes called parameters)\n\n\n\n\n6.1 read.csv arguments\nWhen you call read.csv(), you can use any of the argument from read.table().\n \nAnd there are a lot of arguments in read.table(). The majority of these arguments rarely need to be changed from their default value.\n \nMost of the arguments in read.table() look cryptic and you will probably never have to use them. A couple that are easier to understand:\n\ndecimal: the character that represents a decimal in the decimal number.  You might need to change this to a comma ( , ) if you get data from Europe\ncomment.char: the character after which everything on the line is a comment (i.e., not data)\n\nnotice that read.csv() has no comment.char whereas read.table() uses ( # ) as the default comment.char\n\n\n\n\n6.2 Required arguments and default arguments\nfile is an argument that is not set equal to anything in read.table() / read.csv().  This is because file must be supplied by the user –file is the only required argument.  This should make sense as there is no point in calling read.table() / read.csv() without any data.\n \nMost other argument in read.table() / read.csv() has a default value (except row.names and col.names – there is a question about this in the application). This means you can execute the function without using any argument except file.\n \nIn fact, the following code will produce the same results as the earlier read.csv() call in Figure 1:\nweatherData2 = read.csv(file = \"data/twoWeekWeatherData.csv\");\nIf you look in the Environment tab the values for weatherData and weatherData2 are exactly the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Expanding weatherData and weatherData2 in the Environment tab\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3 The other arguments (aside from file)\nIn my original call to read.csv(), the arguments sep=“,” and header=TRUE are functionally not changing anything because I have them set to the same value as their default.  But, these arguments are changed often enough that it is nice to have them quickly at hand when copying read.csv() from one script to another.\n \n weatherData = read.csv(file=\"data/twoWeekWeatherData.csv\",\n                       sep=\",\",                 \n                       header=TRUE);",

    "text": "3 Putting a formula in code\nOnce again, we will calculate velocity using distance and time, except, we will now use the full version of the velocity formula, which looks at the changes in distance and time as opposed to absolute distance and time.\n \nThe full velocity formula is (subscript i means initial, subscript f means final):\n\\(v=\\frac{d_{f}-d_{i}}{t_{f}-t_{i}}\\) .\n \nNote: If ti and di are zero then you get the formula we used in Lesson 1-2: (\\(\\boldsymbol{v}=\\frac{d}{t}\\))\n \nWe are going to code this formula, but there are a couple of issues:\n\nfractions are “stacked” – but in scripts, equations can only be read left to right\nvariable names have subscript characters (e.g., ti), but subscript and superscript characters are not allowed in script\n\n\n3.1 Minding your parentheses\nIn script, everything goes left-to-right so you cannot write a fraction as you would in Algebra.  Instead, we need to be more explicit and put both both the numerator and the denominator in parentheses:\n\\[\nv=\\frac{\\left(d_{f}-d_{i}\\right)}{\\left(t_{f}-t_{i}\\right)}\n\\]\nThen, pull out the fraction between the numerator and denominator and replace it with a division sign:\n\\[\nv=\\left(d_{f}-d_{i}\\right) /\\left(t_{f}-t_{i}\\right)\n\\]\nNow the formula is all on one line, but the symbols need to be replaced with valid variable names that do not have subscripts:\n\\[\n\\text { velocity }=(\\text { finalDist }- \\text { initDist }) /(\\text { finalTime }- \\text { initTime })\n\\]\nThis is now a valid line of code in R, assuming all four variables on the right side have assigned values.\nvelocity = (finalDist - initDist) / (finalTime - initTime);\nThe line of code above says that velocity will be assigned the value equal to the calculations of the four variables on the right side of the equation.\n\n\n3.2 Other ways to assign values\nIn most programming languages the equal sign is used to assign values, and the equal sign always evaluates what is on the right side and assigns it to the variable on the left.  In R, you can use arrows to assign values:\n«velocity &lt;-» (finalDist - initDist) / (finalTime - initTime); # commonly used\n(finalDist - initDist) / (finalTime - initTime) «-&gt; velocity»; # rarely used\nThe top ( &lt;- ) is the most commonly used in R and the bottom ( -&gt; ) works but is rarely used anymore.  I prefer using ( = ) to ( &lt;- ) because ( = ) is used in most programming languages whereas ( &lt;- ) is not. \n \nNote: In this case, ( = ) and ( &lt;- ) are functionally the same. There are differences between the two, which we will talk about in the lesson on functions.\n\n\n3.3 Variable naming error\nHere is the full script with a small error on the line calculating velocity:\nrm(list=ls());   # Clear out environment\noptions(show.error.locations = TRUE); # give line number of error*\n\nfinalDistance = 100;\ninitDistance = 50;\nfinaltime = 20;       # misspelled: use t instead of T\ninitTime = 15;\n# error will be on the line below:\n«velocity = (finalDistance - initDistance) / (finalTime - initTime)»\nEvery variable on the right side of the velocity equation must be given a value beforehand –  otherwise, you will get the pesky Object not found error as shown in the image below (Figure 1)\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Object not found because the variable name does not exist (it is misspelled).\n\n\n\n \nExtension: The show.error.location line\n \nNote: Object is almost synonymous with Variable in R.  The error is basically saying that there is no variable with that name.  Any spelling error will cause the Object not found error.  In this case I “spelled” the variable name wrong by changing the case of the T.  finaltime is not the same as finalTime.\n \nrm(list=ls());           # clean out the environment\noptions(show.error.locations = TRUE); # give line number of error*\n \nfinalDistance = 100;\ninitDistance = 50;\n«finalTime» = 20;\ninitTime = 15;\nvelocity = (finalDistance - initDistance) / (finalTime - initTime);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Misspelled variable name corrected – script now calculates velocity.",

For Mac, installation is a bit trickier – details below.\n \nNote: Even if you already have the software installed, it is a good idea to verify you have a recent version.\n\n4.1 Install or update R (need version 4.3 or higher)\nThe R for Windows download is here.

Download the appropriate file for your computer under Installers, open the file, and use the default installation options.\n\n4.2.1 Special instructions for Mac users\nFor Mac users there are some extra complexities:\n\nYou might be asked to install Command Line Developer Tools while installing RStudio. Go ahead and install the developer tools.\n \nThe download for RStudio is called RStudio-202X.XX.dmg.  Double-clicking the file will open the window below (Figure 4).  In the window, drag the RStudio file to the Applications folder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Opening RStudio DMG file\n\n\n\nIf you already have RStudio installed, you will be asked if you want to replace the old version – go ahead and Replace it.\n \n\nAfter installation, unmount the RStudio device in the Finder by clicking the eject button (Figure 5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Unmounting the RStudio device (very important!)",

    "text": "6 RStudio Projects and Project Folders\nMost of the work you will do in R involves multiple scripts, data files, and perhaps other types of files.  All these files together make up your project and they exist within a Project Folder, which is the folder on your computer than contains all the files and subfolders for your project – and it is very important that you keep all files associated with a project within a Project Folder.\n \nIn this class we will be using RStudio to create, edit, and execute R scripts.  In RStudio, there is a feature called RStudio Projects, which is a Project Folder, that makes it much easier to move, share, and host your project on GitHub.  You need to keep all of your class work in an RStudio Project.\n\n6.1 Create a new RStudio Project\nTo create a new RStudio Project, which is also your project folder:\n\nopen RStudio\nclick File -&gt; New Project \nIn the Create Project window click New Directory\nIn the Project Type window click New Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Creating a new RStudio Project\n\n\n\n \nIn the Create New Project window:\n\nThe Directory name is the name of the Project Folder that will contain your whole RStudio Project\nThe Project Folder will be created in the folder listed in the second textbox (Create project as subdirectory of:)\n\n \nIn Figure 8, the Project Folder named My_Project will contain the RStudio Project and is in the Desktop folder.  Note: you can name the folder whatever you want and put it in any folder location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Creating a directory for the RStudio Project\n\n\n\n \nExtension: RStudio Project in an existing directory\n\n\n6.2 RStudio Project Files Tab\nThe Files tab (bottom-right corner) in RStudio is a File Manager, and it allows you to do many things that you can do in your operating systems File Manager (called File Explorer in Windows and Finder in Mac). The Files tab can be used to open, add, remove, or rename files and folders. When we first create the RStudio Project, the Files tab will be set to the Project Folder (Figure 9, C:/Users/Charlie/Desktop/My_Project) and there is one file in the folder: My_Project.Rproj.\n \nWhenever you create an RStudio Project, an .Rproj file is added to the Project Folder. This main purpose of this file is to designate this folder as the working directory for your project.  Double-clicking on the .Rproj file will open your Project in RStudio (just like double-clicking a .docx file opens the file in Word).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Files tab opened to the Project Folder\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3 Viewing hidden files in RStudio\nBy default, the Files tab shows file extension but it does not show hidden files.  If you click on More -&gt; Show Hidden Files, you will see the hidden folder .Rproj.user – this is not a folder you will use in this class.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Showing hidden files\n\n\n\nExtension: *.RProj and .Rhistory\n\n\n6.4 Add Subfolders\nWe will use the Files tab in RStudio (bottom-right tab) to create two subfolders: scripts and data.\n \nTo add two folders named scripts and data:\n\nClick on New Folder in the Files tab\nEnter scripts in the textbox and click OK\nRepeat the last two steps to add a folder called data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Adding folders using the Files tab in RStudio\n\n\n\n\n\n6.5 Add files to the project\nWe are going to download two files and add them to your new RStudio Project.\n\nlesson01-Setup.r: put this file in your scripts directory\nlesson01-Setup.csv: put this file in your data directory\n\n\n\n6.6 Opening File Manager from Files tab\nThe Files tab can do a lot of things that File Explorer/Finder can do – but not everything.  For instance, you cannot drag and drop files in the Files tab like you can in File Explorer/Finder.\n \nYou can open up a File Explorer/Finder window to the same folder by clicking More… -&gt; Show Folder in New Window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: The Files tab in RStudio and the File Manager\n\n\n\n\n\n6.7 RStudio Project File Manager\nYou should now be running RStudio, opened to the RStudio Project that you just created.  If you click on the Files tab in the lower-right corner, you will see all the folders and files within your RStudio Project (linked to your Project Folder). You will also see your project name in the upper-right corner (in this case, My_Project).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: RStudio opened with an RStudio Project (named My_Project)\n\n\n\nThe *.RProj files is here and you might also see a file named .RHistory. These are not files you will need to use right away but you can learn more about them at Extension: *.RProj and .Rhistory.",

Extension: The Help Tab\n\n\n7.4 Common buttons used in RStudio\nThe script file, lesson01-Setup.r, is a fully functioning script that takes temperature and wind data from the Comma Separated Value (CSV) file, lesson01-Setup.csv, and plots out the data – the code will be explained later. I am going to use this program to demonstrate a few of the useful buttons in RStudio.\n \nThe one button you will use most in R is Source, which executes your whole script.  Press the Source button to execute the script (Figure 16).\n \nNote: If you have already used R, there is a good chance you highlight lines of code and click Run to execute just those lines.  We are not using this method in this class.  For this class, you should always use Source to execute your code.  For more information go to Extension: Run vs. Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Running (Sourcing) the script\n\n\n\nAfter the script is run:\n\nThe Environment tab displays values for the data (variables) in the script (e.g., weatherData, windLabels).\nThe Console tab displays information about the execution of the script.\nThe Plot tab displays the box plots.  If there are multiple plots, you can use the arrow buttons to switch between the plots.\n\n\n\n7.5 Cleaning up the RStudio windows\nThere many times where you want to clean up the windows, which can get very crowded with information from old script executions.\n\nTo clean the Environment, Plot, and Console tabs use the brush button (Figure 16).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: Cleaning out the windows\n\n\n\n \nIf you click Source again, the Environment, Plot, and Console tabs will once again be populated with data from the script.",

    "section": "12 Extension: Working directories in R and RStudio (why RStudio Projects)",
    "text": "12 Extension: Working directories in R and RStudio (why RStudio Projects)\nThis topic is, in this author’s opinion, the most frustrating topic in R.  This is a topic that can generally be hidden from new programming students but the unique way R handles working directories makes it complex to share projects.\n \nA working directory is the folder location used when one file is looking for another file.  It is best shown by its use-case: a script file that is reading in information from another file – this file can be a data file or another script file.\n \nFor example, let’s say we have a script file called weather.r and it is pulling in data from the file weather2020.csv.  weather.r needs to first find the folder location for weather2020.csv before it can access the file.  To do this, weather.r needs a path to weather2020.csv.  This path can be thought of as map directions between two points – and the working directory is the starting point.\n \nFor the vast majority of programming languages, there is no concept of a working directory.  The process of files calling other files works like google maps – a route is specified between the two files starting with the folder the caller (e.g., weather.r) is in and ending where the callee (e.g., weather.csv) is. The path between the two files is called a relative file path. \n\n12.1 R’s default handling of working directories (it is not good…)\nIn R, the starting point, or working directory, is fixed for all R files opened in a session (called a session variable).  Using the google maps analogy, this is like saying the map starting point is fixed for everyone – it does not matter where you actually are located.  You can change the working directory in your script using setwd() but this changes the working directories for all R files in the session.  In other words, you are simply changing the starting point to a new location and all files will now use that location.\n\n\n12.2 Absolute file paths (a bad fix to the problem)\nOne way to get around working directories is to use an absolute file path.  So, instead of mapping between weather.R and weather.csv, you just give the file path for weather.csv on your computer (called the absolute file path).\n \nThis will look something like: c:\\Users\\RStudent\\Documents\\WeatherProj\\Data\\weather.csv\n \nDoing this means you do not have to worry about working directories.  But this solution breaks as soon as you move files on your computer or move them to another computer.  The reason is that the file path changes.  Absolute file paths make it almost impossible to share file and should not be used.\n\n\n12.3 How RStudio Projects handle working directory (the least-worst option)\nAn RStudio Project sets the working directory to the Project Folder.  So, for weather.r to find weather.csv inside an RStudio Project, it just needs to know where weather.csv is located relative to the project folder.  Most likely this will be something like: Data\\weather.csv. This makes it far easier to share your project because the path to weather.csv will be the same on any computer.\nWhile I believe this is by far the best method for handling working directory issues, it comes with a major caveat:You need to open script files from within the RStudio Project.  Opening the project sets the working directory for all script files used in the session.  If you a file outside of the Project session, then the working directory is not set by the project.\n\n\n12.4 The default working directory\nA working directory is not defined for a file, it is defined for a session.  So, all files within that session will have the same working directory.  IF you change the working directory in one file, you change it for every file within the session.  This leads to awkward behavior where one R file can change the behavior of another R file within the same session by using setwd().",

    "text": "15 Extension: Run vs. Source\nTechnically speaking, the difference between Run and Source is:\n\nSource will execute all the code in a script file.\nRun will execute either:\n\nThe code that is highlighted (if code is highlighted) OR\nThe command that the cursor is on (if the command is on more than one line) OR\nThe whole line the cursor is on\n\n\n \nThe real difference lies in a historical discussion of scripting vs. programming, which is a discussion beyond this class.  Suffice to say, R was originally intended to be more like an advanced calculator than a programming language. The script files would contain multiple lines of code that could be execute independently and in any order (think of these as buttons on a calculator).  The user could click a “button” to pull in data, click another “button” to run statistical analysis on the data, and click a third “button” to output the analysis.  This is what the Run button does.\n \nHowever, as R has grown, the focus has shifted towards developing well-structured code just like any modern programming language (e.g., Python, C, Java). This means executing the script as a whole instead of in parts.  This is what Source does.  Executing your script as a whole instead of in parts has many advantages as the code is easier to debug, easier to share, and much better organized – because you are forced to organize it. In the not-so-humble opinion of this author, learning to treat your script as a whole is a vital part of learning how to program.  For this reason, we will always be using the Source button in this class.",

In an RStudio Project, this is easy because the working directory is always the Project Folder of your project – and all files in the project are contained within the Project Folder.  So, you just need to look for the file relative to the Project Folder.\n \nR Programmers often get around the lack of a Project Folder/defined working directory by setting the working directory in code using setwd().  This can work locally but becomes problematic when files are shared or moved.  Whereas, RStudio Project always maintain their folder structure.",

The R community is extensive and is constantly developing new tools that rival and, in many cases, surpass commercial statistical software and graphing packages.  This class is designed for students new to programming.  While the class focus is on R programming in RStudio, the programming skills taught (e.g., for loops, if-else statements, functions) are designed so that students can transfer their skills to other programming languages like C, JavaScript, or Python.\n \nThe class is a self-paced and asynchronous online class. The amount of material in the class is about the same as a 4 credit, one semester class and students are expected to complete the class within six months.  There are no regularly scheduled office hours but you can email the instructor anytime to ask questions or set up a Zoom meeting.  All contacts will receive a response within one business day.\n\n2.1 Instructor\nCharlie Belinsky\n\nbelinsky@msu.edu\n517-355-0126\n\n\nAbout me…\nI started my career as a Software Engineer for Motorola in Arizona where I developed software for military radios. From there I became a high school teacher in Port Huron, MI where I taught Computer Science, Web Design, and Physical Science. After that, I worked as an Instructional Designer for the College of Education at MSU where my main project was developing the hybrid graduate program. I currently work at the QFC where my primary job is developing and teaching online classes, including this one.  In my free time you will often find me with a backpack deep in a forest or, as my picture testifies to, hanging out on a mountain in the Northern Cascades.\n\n\n2.2 Technical Support\nYou can contact me, Charlie, regarding technical issues.\n \nMSU also offers 24 hour technical support for MSU and MSU Guest students.\n\n517-432-6200 or 844-678-6200 (toll free)\nemail: ithelp@msu.edu\nYou can get an MSU Guest ID here.",

It will be updated as the material for this version gets completed.\n \nThe course has 28 lessons divided into two units: Basic Programming and Data Programming\n \n\nBasic Programming: basic programming structures and operations like variables, inputs, outputs, mathematical operations, if-else structures, for loops, and conditional operations.\n\n1-1 Setup and RStudio Projects: Set up a Project in RStudio and learn the basics of the RStudio programming environment.\n1-2 Variables: Discussion of the different types of variables, variable naming conventions, assigning values to variables, changing values.\n1-3 Mathematical Operations: Mathematical operations on numeric variables, power operations, algebraic formulas in R\n1-4 Vectors and Data Frames: Learn about CSV files and two common data types in R\n1-5 Functions Introduction:Reading function descriptions and using arguments\n1-6 Run and Source: The two ways in R to execute a script and some convenient coding feature in RStudio\n1-7 Outputs: Output information to the console, mixed string, and numeric outputs.\n1-8 Conditional Operators: Creating decision points in your script using if() statements and the six conditional operators.\n1-9 If-Else Statements: Checking multiple conditions on a variable, creating error conditions.\n1-10 For loops: Cycle through data using for loops and performing conditional operations on each value\n1-11 For loops and State Variables: Remembering values as you cycle through for loops\n1-12 Multiple Conditions: Checking complex conditions on a variable using logical operators & and\n1-13 Functions: Creating your own function, adding and using arguments and return values \n1-14 Function 2: Default arguments, putting functions in separate files, calling external files\n1-15 Functions 3: More complex functions and Boolean arguments\n\nData Programming: data programming structures and operations like file inputs, vectors, subset operations, plotting, and data types.\n\n2-1 GGPlot Introduction: Structures within GGPlot, creating basic plots from data in a data frame\n2-2 Data frame Modifications: Add, remove, and reorder column in a data frame, and manipulating string values\n2-3 Data types and Data Frames: Conversion between data types, NA values, common issues with data frames\n2-4 Which Statements: Conditionally subset numeric data, plot subsetted data\n2-5 Which and Regular Expressions: Conditionally subset string data, finding patterns in string values \n2-6 Datetime Objects: Formatted date and datetime values, converting from strings to datetime value \n2-7 Matrices: Create two-dimensional data, performing statistics on 2D data\n2-8 Binding and Sampling: Combining data and creating randomly sampled values\n2-9 Stacking and Mapping: Plotting multiple columns in a data frame at once, mapping data to color and size\n2-10 Statistical Tests: t-tests, ANOVAs, linear regressions and storing and reading information from the tests \n2-11 Objects and Attributes: deeper dive into the data types in R and their attributes\n2-12 Lists: Reading, navigating, subsetting, and creating List objects in R \n2-13 Breakpoints: a method for debugging your code \n\n\n\n4.1 Lesson Application\nAll lessons have an Application section at the end that will ask you to apply what you learned in the lesson in your own script. The Application is the only product that gets evaluated. There are no tests and there is no final exam.\n \nThe class is self-paced, however you should not go more than 2 weeks without handing in an application unless you inform the instructor that there will be a delay.  You will have a chance to redo all applications.\n\n\n4.2 Lesson feedback\nEach application has these three questions regarding the lesson:\n\nWhat was your level of comfort with the lesson/application?\nWhat areas of the lesson/application confused or still confuses you?\nWhat are some things you would like to know more about that is related to, but not covered in, this lesson?\n\n \nThese questions are vital for feedback in this class and far more useful to me than end-of-class surveys as they give me real-time information.  Please take a few minutes to answer these questions.  Feedback from these questions has become my main way of improving the class.  In return, I promise to address concerns and questions from your responses.\n\n\n4.3 Extensions and Traps\nMany of the lessons contain optional content called Extension and Traps.  Extensions contain material that goes beyond the lesson’s objectives and Traps capture some of the common issues students have with the lesson’s objectives.  There are links to Extensions and Traps within the Content area of the lesson.  Clicking on the appropriate link takes you directly to the Extension or Trap.

    "text": "6 Lesson features (technical)\nThis sections goes over some of the technological features built into the lessons.\n\n6.1 Long-click menu\nIf you long-click (hold left-button for about half a second) anywhere on any lesson page Figure 2, try it!), you are given options to:\n\nReturn to the Previous Position (only appears after you have jumped to a position on the page)\nGo to Top of Page\nPrint/ Save as PDF (same as the lesson’s Print link)\nMaximize All Images\nMinimize All Images\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The long-click menu – this view is from Firefox .\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2 Resizing Pictures\nMost images in the course can be resized so that the picture is out of your way when you don’t need to view it.\n \nClicking on the image toggles it between the minimized and maximized states.\nClicking and dragging on the image allows you to resize the image to any size. (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Test picture to resize (Ninh Bình, Việt Nam)\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3 Figures and references\nWhen you click on a figure reference (e.g., Figure 3), the caption on the figure will highlight for 2 seconds.\n \nIf the figure is not on the screen, then the page will scroll to the figure and highlight it.  For instance, clicking on Figure 1 will take you to the Zoom figure near the top of this page.  You can return to this position by long-clicking and selecting Return to the Previous Position\n\n\n6.4 Printing lessons and saving lessons to PDF\nYou can print any lesson or save it as a PDF by clicking on the Printer icon at the top of every lesson (and this syllabus).  This will bring up a print dialog (Figure 4) and you can print the lesson to a printer.  On most machines, you can also choose a PDF device as a printer – this will save the lesson as a PDF document.\n \nNote: Using your browser’s print feature instead on the Print link will print out the whole webpage instead of just the lesson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: This author has two print-to-PDF devices – the Microsoft Print to PDF, which comes with Windows 10 and 11, works fine\n\n\n\n\n6.4.1 Print-to-PDF Software\nIf you are using Windows 7 or 8 you might not have a PDF device and you will need to download Print-to-PDF software. You can see if you have a PDF device by going to the print options in any program and see if any of the devices have “PDF” in their name (Figure 4).  If you don’t have a PDF device, then I recommend you install CutePDF (direct link to the file download).  CutePDF is simple and powerful print-to-PDF software that does not try to install any extra software on your computer. Trap: Bloatware\n\n\n\n6.5 Codeblocks\nClicking on the clipboard in the upper-right corner of the codeblock (Figure 5) will copy the code to the clipboard. You can then paste the code into RStudio (or any other text editor)\n\n\n\n# the next two lines should be at the top of all your scripts\nrm(list=ls());\noptions(show.error.locations = TRUE);\n# create three variables: d, t, and v\n# give d and t values and use them to calculate v\nd = 100;\nt = 20;\nv = d/t;\n\n\nFigure 5: Clicking on clipboard in upper-right corner selects all the text and copies it to the clipboard\n\n\n\n\n\n6.6 Special note about images in the lessons for this class\nRStudio is a rapidly evolving program, and it would be too much work to maintain all the lesson images in order to reflect the visual likeness of the newest version of RStudio.  Some of the images in this class still reflect the 2019 version of RStudio (when R was still at version 3.5). There are also minor changes that I have made to the code that I did not believe warrants putting in new images.  For instance, my RStudio Project name might change between images and some of the RStudio buttons and tabs will look slightly different (think of it as a check on how observant you are!).  I have tried to make sure these differences change nothing functionally.  Inevitably, something will fall through the cracks – so please, contact the instructor if there is something causing a problem!",

    "section": "4 Different types of variables",
    "text": "4 Different types of variables\nVariables is a widely used term found in many different fields, and its definition is not consistent across the fields.  In this class, when I say variable I am referring to a programming variable. When I am referring to a variable in another field, I will add the field to the term variable (e.g., algebraic variable, experimental variable, statistical variable).\n\n4.1 Algebraic variables\nIn Physics, we use algebraic variables to describe the relationship between physical properties.  For example, velocity can be expressed algebraically as  v=d/t where v, d, and t are symbols representing the physical properties of velocity, distance, and time.  The formula states that the relationship v=d/t is always maintained even as the individual values change.\n \nIn this case, v, d, and t are all algebraic variables that have the following properties:\n\nName: v, d, t (name is synonymous with symbol)\nType: numeric (v, d, and t are all numbers)\nValue: given by situation – the value can be known or unknown\n\n\n\n4.2 Variables in programming\nIn programming, variables work in a similar way. Variables in programming are named storage locations in memory that hold information.\n \nThis information could be\n\na runner’s distance, time, and velocity\nthe number of fish caught in a day\nthe name of the lake the fish were caught in\nweather information such as temperature, humidity, or wind speed\n\n \nLike algebraic variables, variables in programming have a name, type, and value.\n\n4.2.1 Name\nThe name corresponds to the symbol in our physics example above – it is how the variable is represented in the script.  The name is used to reference the storage location in memory that holds the value.  For our initial example, we will use v, d, and t as the variable names.  Later in this lesson, I will talk about variable naming conventions.\n\n\n4.2.2 Value \nThe value is the information that is stored in the location pointed to by the name, so when v = 10 , that means there is a storage location in memory named v, and in that location, there is the number 10. Note: we will worry about units later.\n \nTrap: Constant variables in R\n\n\n4.2.3 Type\nThe type describes what kind of value is being stored in memory which, in turn, tells R what kind of operations can be performed on the variable. Distance, velocity, and time all have numeric values, and mathematical operations can be performed on them.\n \nNumeric is one type of value a variable can have, some of the other types of values are:\n\nstrings (also called characters): a text value (e.g., a lake name)\ncategorical: a limited set of text values (e.g., the four seasons or the five Great Lakes)\nBoolean: a TRUE/FALSE statement\nDate: a date in day-month-year format\n\n \nWe will talk more about the non-numeric variable types in future lessons, for now, we will stick with numeric variables.",

Do not leave it as Untitled1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Opening a new R file in RStudio\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Add code to the script\nCopy and paste the following lines into the code window and click the Source button in the bar above the code (or click Code -&gt; Source):\nrm(list=ls());    # Clear out the Environment     \n  \n# create two variables: d and t and give them values\nd = 100;\nt = 20;\n# create a variable v that is calculated using d and t\nv = d/t;\nLines 1 cleans out the Environment tab (top-right corner) each time the script is executed.  This provides you with a clean slate each time you run a script and I put this line at the top of most of my scripts.\nExtension: Why clear the Environment tab?\n \nLine 1 also has an inline comment that starts with #. Everything after the # is informational and does not get executed.\n \nLines 3 and 6 are full comment lines – again, they are informational and there to make the script easier to understand.  You can take them out and the script will produce the same result.\n \nLines 4, 5, and 7 are where the real action occurs and each line contains a variable assignment:\n\nLine 4 assigns the value 100 to the variable named d\nLine 5 assigns the value 20 to the variable named t\nLine 7 assigns the value of the calculation d/t to the variable named v.\n\n \nLines 1, 4, 5, and 7 all have semicolons ( ; ) at the end.  The semicolon designates the end of a programming command just like the period designates the end of a sentence.  The semicolon is optional in R and is often not used, but I highly recommend the use of semicolons in all of your scripts. Semicolons allow for more flexibility (e.g., you can put multiple “sentences” on one line), help you think about the flow of your code, and are required in many programming languages.\n \nTrap: Assignment vs. Equality Operations\nExtension: alternate assignment operator\n\n\n5.4 Execute your code – the Environment tab\nClick Source to execute your R code ( Figure 3 ).  Your RStudio window should look similar to this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Executing (sourcing) the velocity-distance-time script\n\n\n\nNotice that the Environment tab displays the values for the variables v, d, and t. The Environment tab displays every variable in your script and is a very useful tool for viewing the results of your script and for debugging when things go wrong..\n \nTry changing the values for d and t (lines 7 and 8) and click Source again to see how the values in the Environment tab change.\n\n5.4.1 The Unexpected end of document error\nIn Figure 3 there is a red x on the last line indicating an error. The error says unexpected end of document. This is not a real problem, it will not cause any issues with your script. It is a bug in how RStudio deals with semicolons. You can remove the last semicolon if you want to get rid of the error.",

But, as of line 9, d is still equal to 100. v does not get updated because one of the variables used to calculate it (in this case, d) changes afterwards. The script runs in order, and variables are not updated retroactively.\n \nIn other words, v will remain 5 until it is explicitly assigned another value.\n \nTrap: Assigning nonexistent variables\n\n6.1 Reassigning values to a variable\nWhat happens if you add the line v=d/t at the end of the script? Try the following code and click Source\nrm(list=ls());    # Clear out the Environment    \n  \n# create three variables: d, t, and v\n# give d and t values and use them to calculate v\nd = 100; # assign d the value 100\nt = 20;\nv = d/t; # use d to calculate v\n\nd = 400; # re-assigns d to 400\nv = d/t; # re-assign v using the new value of d\nNotice that now the value of v has changed.  This is because line 10 assigns a new value to v calculated using the value of d from line 9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Assign a new value to v after assigning the new value to d",

    "text": "8 Naming variables\nThe problem with variable names like v, d, and t is that they are not very descriptive.  It is good programming practice to give names that are descriptive so that people reading your code can more easily understand what is going on. \n \nThe first step would be to spell the variable names out, for example: velocity, distance, and time.\n \nHowever, a script solving for velocity will probably be calculating multiple velocities.  Perhaps the script is calculating the velocity of both a runner and a car – the variable names should reflect this. \n\n8.1 Naming Rules\nThere are a few rules for naming a variable:\n\nIt must start with a letter\nIt can only contain letters, numbers, or the underscore ( _ )\n\ndots ( . ) are also accepted in R but dots are not accepted in most programming languages\nthis means no spaces!\n\nThere are system reserved words you cannot use as variable names (e.g., if, else, for, while, TRUE, FALSE, function, next…).  We will learn what these reserved words mean in future lessons.\n\n\n\n8.2 Naming Conventions\nThere are two common programming conventions for variables names:\n\nCapitalize the first letter of every word except the first: runnerVelocity, runnerDistance, runnerTime\nPut an underscore ( _ ) between each word:  runner_velocity, runner_distance, runner_time\n\n \nTrap: Case counts in variable names\n \nFor all your class work, you need to use these two conventions.  I will use the first convention in most of my examples.\n \nNote: R programmers often use dots in variable names: runner.velocity, runner.distance.  I do not recommend this as this method will not work in most other programming languages.",

    "text": "3 Vector Variables\nVector variables, or vector for short, are variables that hold multiple related values.  For instance if we have temperature values for 5 days, we could create 5 variables and assign each one a temperature value:\ntempHigh1 = 65;\ntempHigh2 = 57;\ntempHigh3 = 61;\ntempHigh4 = 64;\ntempHigh5 = 59;\nAnd, in the last lesson’s application, we averaged the 5 values like this:\ntempAvg = (tempHigh1 + tempHigh2 + tempHigh3 +\n           tempHigh4 + tempHigh5) / 5;\n\n3.1 Grouping values\nBut, in programming we want to group related values together.  So, instead of creating 5 different variables, we create one vector that has 5 values:\ntempHigh = c(65, 57, 61, 64, 59);\nOne of the main reasons to create a vector is that the values in the vector are all associated and we can perform mathematical operations on the whole vector.  For instance, the vector might consist of multiple temperatures in Fahrenheit and want to convert all the temperatures to Celsius:\ntempHighCel = (5/9) * (tempHigh - 32)\nOr, we can use one of R’s many, many statistical functions, mean(), on the vector:\ntempMean = mean(tempHigh); \nAfter executing the code in this section, we can see in the Environment tab that tempHighCel has 5 converted temperatures and that tempMean is the same as tempAvg:\ntempAvg:     61.2\ntempHigh:    num [1:5] 65 57 61 64 59\ntempHighCel: num [1:5] 18.3 139 16.1 17.5 15\ntempMean:    61.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: View of temperature values in Environment\n\n\n\nExtension: Statistical functions on vectors\n\n\n3.2 Indexing values in a vector\nPutting values into vectors also allows us to associated values between vectors.  If we have a vector of high temperature values, then we could also have a vector of low temperature values.\ntempLow = c(45, 40, 55, 37, 42);\nWe can directly subtract tempLow values from tempHigh to get the difference in temperature for all values:\ntempDiff = tempHigh - tempLow;\nWe can index individual values.  You could think of the vector as 5 days.  And if you want, you can find the change in temperature for any day using the index 1 through 5:\ntempDiff_3 = tempHigh[3] - tempLow[3];\ntempDiff_5 = tempHigh[5] - tempLow[5];\nThe Environment shows:\ntempHigh:    num [1:5] 65 57 61 64 59\ntempLow:     num [1:5] 45 40 55 37 42\ntempDiff:    num [1:5] 20 17 6 27 17\ntempDiff_3:  6\ntempDiff_5:  17\n\n\n3.3 Vectors and columns in a data frame\nData frames are made up of vectors that all have the same length.  The vectors are the columns in the data frame and the number of values in the vector is determined by the number of rows in the data frame.\n \nIn Figure 2 there is a weather data frame (note: we are using this data frame in future lessons, not this one) where each column has a measured daily weather value (e.g., minTemp, maxTemp, relHum).  Each row gives the measured weather values for a specific day (e.g., row 1 is Jan 1, row 2 is Jan 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A data frame viewed in RStudio with 23 variables (i.e., the 23 columns, which are vector variables)",

    "text": "4 CSV files\nIn the first couple of lessons we were using data from inside the script but most of the data you will use will come from outside the script – often from a data frame. The data frames themselves often come from a CSV file. CSV stands for Comma Separated Values, meaning that the values in the file are separated by commas.\n \nNote: CSV is really just a text file that can be read in any text editor and CSV file do not have to use commas as separators.\n \nLet’s look at a small data set we downloaded in the Section 1.1 section called twoWeekWeatherData.csv, which contains two weeks of weather data from Lansing, Michigan. \n\n4.1 Opening a CSV file\nNote: CSV files are often opened by default in Excel and this can problematic: Trap: Opening CSV files in Excel\n \nCSV files are just text files and CSV files can be opened in any text editor (e.g., notepad, notepad++, textEdit).\n \nRStudio is also a text editor so we can open and edit twoWeekWeatherData.csv in RStudio by either:\n\nClicking File -&gt; Open File… and navigate to twoWeekWeatherData.csv and press OK.\nUsing the Files tab: navigate to the data folder, click on twoWeekWeatherData.csv, choose View File (Figure 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The twoWeekWeatherData.csv file opened in RStudio\n\n\n\n \nThe CSV file has 15 lines (rows).  The first row contains the 5 column headers and the other 14 rows contain the 5 values for each date – all separated by a comma.\n\n\n4.2 Reading in a CSV file\nWe can see that the CSV file has a header row and each row has five values representing: date, highTemp, lowTemp, precipitation, noonCondition.\n \nTo use the data in a script we need to read the data into a script file – and for that we will use the read.csv() function.\n# Get the data from the twoWeekWeatherData CSV file\nweatherData = «read.csv»(file=\"data/twoWeekWeatherData.csv\", \n                       sep=\",\",\n                       header=TRUE);\nread.csv() reads in the data from the CSV file – and saves the data to a variable called weatherData.\n \nweatherData is a data frame variable and it appears in the Environment tab under Data as 14 obs. of 5 variables. (i.e., 14 rows and 5 columns), which matches what we saw in the CSV file (Figure 3). \n\nDouble-clicking on weatherData opens the data frame in the File Viewer window.  This is a convenient way to visualize the data frame.\nClicking on the blue arrow to the left of weatherData provides information about each of the columns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Viewing the data frame in the File Viewer\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Column value type\nIn the Environment, when you click on the arrow next to the left of weatherData (Figure 2) you see some information about the columns in the data frame. The first piece of information is the name of the column (i.e., the header – date, highTemp, etc.).  The second is the type of value the column contains.\n \nIn weatherData there are three types of values:\n\nint (e.g., highTemp and lowTemp): integer – or non-decimal numbers\nnum (e.g., precipitation): numeric, or numbers with decimals\nchr: (e.g, noonCoondition) this stands for character, and character is really short for string of characters, and this in turn is typically shortened to string.  Whatever you call it, it is the catch-all category for values R cannot recognize as anything else. \n\n \nNote: the date column has date values but it is not formatted properly so R does not recognize it as a Date – something we will cover much later.",

A function is a set of code separate from your main script that performs a common task (e.g., plotting values, finding a standard deviation, reading in a file).\n \nThere is a lot going on in our first line of code and that is because there are a lot of options, called arguments, when opening up a CSV file!  We will talk a little bit about these arguments here and save the rest of the discussion for the next lesson.\n \nInside the function read.csv(), I included three arguments (file, sep, and header).  Arguments are like the knobs and dials for a function.  The function reads in a CSV file and the arguments tweak how the file is read.\n\n5.1 file\nfile = “data/twoWeekWeatherData.csv” means that the script opens the file called twoWeekWeatherData.csv located in the data folder of your RStudio Project\n \nThis only works if you are in the RStudio Project because the RStudio Project sets the Working Directory to your Project Folder.\n \nIf you execute the script file outside your RStudio Project (Figure 5), you will get a cannot open file error in the Console because the script does not know to find the CSV file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: You get a cannot open file error if you try to execute the script outside of your RStudio Project\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 sep\nsep = “,” means that the values in the file are separated by commas.  This is not always true – even for CSV files.\n \nThe most common alternate separator values are spaces ( sep = ” “ ) and dots ( sep = “.” )\n\n\n5.3 header\nheader = TRUE means the first row contains header information. In this case the header information is the column names (date, highTemp, lowTemp, and precipitation)\n \nheader = FALSE would mean that the first row contains data (i.e., there are no column names).  If you set header=FALSE in this example then R will think that the column names are the first data point.  So, you will have 15 values in each vector and the first value will not make sense.\n\n\n5.4 Default values for arguments\nBy default, read.csv() assumes sep=“,” and header=TRUE. For the data in this example, sep and header are need needed and this code would work:\nweatherData = read.csv(file=\"data/twoWeekWeatherData.csv\");\nBut I like to keep sep and header in my code because you often do need to change them (e.g., you have data without a header or spaces between values instead of commas) and it is easier to deal with if you already have sep and header when copying code from one script to another.",

    "text": "6 Getting data\nWe now have a data frame with weather information stored in a variable called weatherData.  But, we usually do not want to deal with the whole data frame at once.  So, our next trick will be to extract parts of the data from the data frame.  We might want to work with one column in the data frame (e.g., highTemp or precipitation).  We can see all the columns in the data frame by expanding the data frame in the Environment or looking at the headers in the File Viewer (both views are in Figure 4). \n\n6.1 Pulling out a column\nColumns in a data frame are vectors (i.e., a variable with multiple values) and we can save the columns to a vector.  We can access the columns from a data frame using the $ operator.\n \nWe start with weatherData and, use the dollar sign operator ( $ ) to access the highTemp column, and save the results to the vector called highTemps:\nhighTemps = weatherData$highTemp;\nIn the Environment square brackets ([ ] ) indicates the variable is a vector.  highTemps appears in the Environment as a vector.  highTemps has 14 ( [1:14] ) integer (int) values, representing the temperature for each of the 14 days. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: The highTemps vector variable in the Environment tab\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2 Pulling out (subsetting) individual values\nPerhaps we want just one value – specifically, we want to know the high temperature on April 2 (the seventh day in weatherData).\n \nThere are multiple ways to access that individual value.  I will present three, but for the rest of this lesson, we are going to use the first method.\n \nWe could subset using the subset operator ( [ ] ) the 7th value from highTemps:\nhighTempDay7a = highTemps[7];\nWe could go back to the original data frame (weatherData) and subset the 7th value from the column highTemp:\nhighTempDay7b = weatherData$highTemp[7];\nOr, we can use a row/column (e.g., X/Y) operation on weatherData to get the value:\nhighTempDay7c = weatherData[7, \"highTemp\"];  # think of this as [X,Y] notation\nThe last method is functionally the same as the previous two – but the X,Y notation is the most robust as it can best handle more complex subsetting situations (e.g., subsetting multiple rows and columns), which will be discussed in a future lesson.\n\n\n6.3 The Environment and the L value\nI will be referring quite often to the Environment tab as it looks after the script has been sourced (as in Figure 6) .  Instead of taking a screenshot of the Environment tab (which is hard to maintain), I will display the variables I am focused on like this:\nhighTemp7a:  60L\nhighTemp7b:  60L\nhighTemp7c:  60L\nThe Environment tab shows that highTemp7a, highTemp7b, and highTemp7c are all equal to 60L\n \nThe L is something you can ignore – it indicates that the number is an long integer, which is an integer.

    "section": "7 Pulling out multiple values",
    "text": "7 Pulling out multiple values\nWe have pulled out a column from a data frame and we have pulled out individual values.  In this section, we will show different ways to pull out multiple values with:\n\nAn index vector created using c()\nA regular (or, simple) sequence using the colon ( : ) operator\nA more complex sequence using the seq() function\n\n\n7.1 Using a numeric vector to pull multiple values\nhighTemps is a vector with 14 values and each of these values can be accessed by their numeric placement:\nval_01 = highTemps[1];\nval_05 = highTemps[5];\nval_12 = highTemps[12];\nOr, we might want to combine the temperatures from these three days into one variable.  c() creates a vector of the three values (1, 5, and 12) and that vector is used to subset highTemps:\nvalComb = highTemps[c(1,5,12)];  # a vector with 3 values\nvalComb is a vector with 3 values, the high temperature for days 1, 5, and 12:\n\n\n\nval_01:    57L\nval_05:    39L\nval_12:    54L\nvalComb:   int [1:3] 57 39 54\n\n\nFigure 7: The three values we pulled from highTemps individually saved and combined (valComb)\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2 Pulling out consecutive values\nIf we want to get the high temperature for consecutive days, we can use the simple sequencing ( : ) operator – simple refers to the fact that we are sequencing by 1:\nconsecVals = highTemps[3:11];  # same as highTemps[c(3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11)]\nconsecVals is a vector with 9 values – the high temperatures from days 3 through 11.  Note: 9 values, not 8 – we include both the 3 and the 11.\n \nThe ( : ) operator also works in reverse\nconsecValsRev = highTemps[11:3];\nconsecValsRev is a vector with 9 values – the high temperatures from days 11 down to 3.\n\n\n\nconsecVals:     int [1:9] 54 40 39 ...\nconsecValsRev:  int [1:9] 39 44 55 ...\n\n\nFigure 8: int [1:9] means 9 values are in each vector – the first few values are shown\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3 Using the Console to view values in a vector\nThe Environment tab is good for quickly looking at values, but it only shows a few values from each vector.  If you want to see all the values then you can use the Console tab (bottom-left corner).  In the Console tab, type in the variable you want to see and press Enter:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Using the Console tab to view variables\n\n\n\n \nThese two values, consecVals and consecValRev, are shown in the Console window in Figure 9. In the future I will present the Console like this:\n&gt; consecVals \n[1] 54 40 39 58 60 53 55 44 39 \n&gt; consecValsRev \n[1] 39 44 55 53 60 58 39 40 54\n\n\n7.4 Using a sequence to get values\nWe can use the seq() to create a more complex sequence to subset a vector.\n \nThis is a two step process:\n\nCreate a sequence. \nUse the sequence to subset the vector. \n\n\n7.4.1 Creating a sequence\nseq() is a function with three arguments:\n\nfrom: the starting point\nto: the ending point\nby: the iteration\n\n \nWe can create a sequence that lists every other number from 1-14\nseq1 = seq(from=1, to=14, by=2);\nWe can reverse the sequence by switching the to and from and inverting the by\nseq2 = seq(from=14, to=1, by=-2);\nWe can get every 3rd number for the first 10 numbers:\nseq3 = seq(from=1, to=10, by=3);\nThe 3 sequences we created are just vectors of numbers:\nseq1:   1 3 5 7 9 11 13\nseq2:   14 12 10 8 6 4 2\nseq3:   1 4 7 10\n\n\n7.4.2 Using the sequences as indexes\nWe can use the 3 sequences above as index vectors to index the highTemps vector:\n \nGet every other high temperature:\nhighTempSeq1 = highTemps[seq1];\nGet every other high temperature in reverse:\nhighTempSeq2 = highTemps[seq2];\nGet every 3rd high temperature value in the first 10 values:\nhighTempSeq3 = highTemps[seq3];\n\n\n\nhighTempSeq1:  int [1:7] 57 54 39 60 ...\nhighTempSeq2:  int [1:7] 75 54 44 53 ...\nhighTempSeq3:  int [1:4] 57 40 60 44\n\n\nFigure 10: There are 7 values in the first two sequences and 4 in the third\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.3 Combining the above 2 steps\nYou can combine the above two steps in 1 command.\n \nThe following command will give you the same high temperature values:\nhighTempSeq1b = highTemps[seq(from=1, to=14, by=2)];  \nhighTempSeq2b = highTemps[seq(from=14, to=1, by=-2)];  \nhighTempSeq3b = highTemps[seq(from=1, to=10, by=3)];\nExtension: Square brackets [ ] vs. Round Brackets ( )\n\n\n7.4.4 Note about combining steps in R\nWhile it might seem like combining steps is a good idea because it reduces the amount of code, this needs to be balanced with the fact that combining code usually makes it harder to read.  One of the big problems I see when looking at people’s code is that they cram too much code into one command and it becomes really difficult to debug if anything goes wrong.  If you are going to err on one side then this author recommends you err on the side of breaking up code rather than combining it.",

    "text": "3 Run vs. Source\nThe Source button is used to execute the whole script (i.e., every command in the script) while the Run button is used to selectively execute commands.  Run is a great tool for debugging and testing your code and we are going to almost exclusively use Run for the next two lessons.\n \nThe next two lessons are more about showing off features in R and RStudio and not about creating a full script.  However, your goal with most scripts is to be able to execute the file using Source.  It takes longer to develop you script using Source but it forces you to automate your script which makes your script both easier to debug and share.\n\n3.1 Executing one line\nWe already have an example of using Run to execute one line in Figure 2.  When we put the cursor on line 4 and clicked Run, R executed the cat() command on line 4.  We will talk much more about cat() next lesson but cat() outputs to the Console whatever is in the parentheses.\n \nActually, clicking Run does not just execute the line, but everything associate with the command on the line.  When you look at the Console output, you see that lines 3 and 4 were both executed – but line 3 was just a comment line so it does not do anything.\n\n\n\n&gt;   ### Output a text message  \n&gt;   cat(\"Hello\");             \nHello                          \n\n\nFigure 3: Lines in Console that start with a ( &gt; ) are command lines\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Executing multiple commands on one line\nYou can put as many command as you want on one line as long as use semicolons between them.\n \nThe following line has three commands that\n\ncreate two variables (a and b)\noutput the addition of them to the Console. \n\na=3; b=7; cat(\"a+b=\", a+b);\nClicking Run on the line will add a and b to the Environment:\na:   3\nb:   7\nAnd the addition of a and b is displayed in the Console:\n&gt;   ### Multiple commands on one line\n&gt;   a=3; b=7; cat(\"a+b=\", a+b);\na+b= 10\nIf you remove the semicolons then you will get the error: unexpected symbol in ”  a=3 b”\nBasically, R is saying the it does not understand what the symbol b means because R thinks that b is a continuation of the a=3 command.\n\n\n3.3 Executing highlighted script\nYou can also highlight parts of your script and Run will executed exactly what is highlighted.\n \nIf you completely highlight lines 10, 11, and 12:\n  cat(\"Hello, World.\\n\");\n  cat(\"How are you?\\n\");\n  cat(\"I am fine?\\n\");\nand click Run, the output to the Console is:\n\n\n\n&gt;   cat(\"Hello, World.\\n\");\nHello, World.\n&gt;   cat(\"How are you?\\n\");\nHow are you?\n&gt;   cat(\"I am fine?\\n\");\nI am fine?\n\n\nFigure 4: Three commands sent to Console by clicking Run\n\n\n\nWhen you highlight code and click Run, Run will execute exactly what you highlight.  So, if you accidentally highlight a bit of line 9 along with lines 10-12:\n  ### Outputting multiple text messages «(\\n means go to next line)»\n  «cat(\"Hello, World.\\n\");»\n  «cat(\"How are you?\\n\");»\n  «cat(\"I am fine?\\n\");»\nThen in the Console you will get the error:\n&gt; (\\n means go to next line)\nError: unexpected symbol in \"(\\n\"\nR is trying to execute the last part of line 9 and R does not know that this is supposed to be part of a comment because you did not highlight the ### part of the line.\n \nTo recap, when you click Run and…:\n\n…the cursor is in a line: R will execute all commands on that line.\n…part of your code is highlighted: R will execute exactly what is highlighted\n\n\n\n3.4 Executing one command on multiple lines\nLines 15-17 contain the command to open the twoWeekWeatherData.csv file and save the data to a data frame named weatherData.\n  ### read in data from  twoWeekWeatherData.csv\n  weatherData = read.csv(file=\"data/twoWeekWeatherData.csv\", \n                         sep=\",\",\n                         header=TRUE);\nIf we put the cursor on any line from 15-17 and click Run, R will execute all 3 lines.  When you click Run, R will execute whatever command the cursor is in the middle of.  In this case, the command starts on line 15 with weatherData = and ends on line 17 with header=TRUE);.\n \nWhen we Run line 15, the Console output shows lines 14-17 (14 is a comment) were executed – the ( + ) at the beginning of the lines in the Console says that this line is a continuation of the command from the previous line.\n\n\n\n&gt;   ### read in data from  twoWeekWeatherData.csv\n&gt;   weatherData = read.csv(file=\"data/twoWeekWeatherData.csv\", \n«+»                         sep=\",\",\n«+»                          header=TRUE);\n\n\nFigure 5: Console output when executing the multi-line command to open the csv file\n\n\n\nExecuting lines 14-17 means that you have a new variable named weatherData and this variable is put in the Environment tab:\n\n\n\nweatherData   14 obs. of 5 variables\n\n\nFigure 6: The Environment tab after the read.csv() command was executed",

This means that a number is unambiguously not a variable.\n \nHowever, you can put quotes around a number:\n  if(highTemps[2] &gt;= \"50\")  # this will often give a wrong answer...\nThis change the number 50 to the two characters: “5” and “0”.  Coincidentally, the if() statement above is also TRUE, but for the wrong reason.  Extension: Numbers as Characters\n\n\n8.2 Case counts with strings\nWhen comparing two strings, any difference between the two strings means they are not equal (so, == is FALSE and != is TRUE).  This includes capital and lowercase letters.\n \nnoonCond[2] is “Cloudy” but “Cloudy” is not the same as “cloudy”:\ncat(\"\\n---------\\nChecking same condition but changed 'Cloudy' to 'cloudy':\\n\");\n\nif(noonCond[2] == \"cloudy\") # This is FALSE because of the lowercase c\n{\n  cat(\"  Day was cloudy\\n\");\n}\nif(noonCond[2] != \"cloudy\") # This is TRUE\n{\n  cat(\"  Day was NOT cloudy\\n\"); \n}\nAnd in the Console we see that “Cloudy” does not equal “cloudy”:\nChecking same condition but changed 'Cloudy' to 'cloudy':\n  Day was NOT cloudy",

    "text": "15 Extension: Numbers as Characters\nA common problem in R is that variables that look like numbers can really be a string/character.\n \nIf you add these variables to your script:\nnum1 = 50;\nnum2 = \"50\";\nThen num1 is an integer but num2 is a string/character.\nIn other words, num1 is 50 and num2 is the character “5” followed by the character “0”.\n \nThis means the mathematical and conditional operators will not work on num2 as you would expect:\n\n\n\n&gt; num2 &gt; 30\n[1] TRUE\n&gt; num2 &gt; 70\n[1] FALSE\n&gt; num2 &gt; 300\n[1] TRUE\n&gt; num2 &gt; 7\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nFigure 4: Conditional operators on numbers that are really string/characters: num2 = “50”\n\n\n\nSince num2 is “50”, the first two seem correct, “50” is greater than 30 and not greater than 70.\n \nBut adding or taking away “0” does not change the result of the conditional operator so “50” is still greater than 300 and not greater than 7.\n \nThis happens because R does not think of “50” as a number but as two characters, a “5” and a “0”.  And since R sees “50” as two character, R is making an alphabetical comparison of the “numbers”:\n\n\n\n&gt; num2 &gt; \"30\"\n[1] TRUE\n&gt; num2 &gt; \"70\"\n[1] FALSE\n&gt; num2 &gt; \"300\"\n[1] TRUE\n&gt; num2 &gt; \"7\"\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nFigure 5: Conditional operators on strings that have numbers in them\n\n\n\nAlphabetic comparisons start with the leftmost character so “Frank” is greater than “Charlie” and not greater than “Harry”. Using this logic, R sees “5” as greater than “3” and not greater than “7”.  It does not matter what, or how many, “numbers” come afterwards\n \nWhen doing an alphabetical comparison, if the first character is different then you do not need to look beyond the first character when doing a conditional operator.",

    "text": "7 The index variable in a for loop\nThe true power of the for loops lies in the indexing variable, which is often named i.  Note: the indexing variable can be given any name – it’s just common to call it i.  The indexing variable changes every time the for loop executes so the indexing variable can be used to modify the code every time the codeblock is executed.\n\n7.1 The index variable as a counter\nLet’s look at the simplest of examples – using the indexing variable, i, as a counter:\n# Using the indexing variable i as a counter\nfor(i in 1:5) # repeat 5 times\n{\n  cat(\"The count is:\", i, \"\\n\");\n}\nThis outputs:\nUsing the indexing variable as a counter:\nThe count is: 1\nThe count is: 2\nThe count is: 3\nThe count is: 4\nThe count is: 5\n\n\n7.2 Taking a step back: How a for loop cycles\nA for loops always consists of 3 things:\n\nAn indexing variable:  for(i in 1:5) \nA sequence of values: for(i in 1:5)\nA codeblock to execute: between the { }\n\n \nThe sequence of values determines how many times the codeblock will cycle.  If there are 12 values in the sequence, then the for loop will cycle12 times.\n \nFor each cycle, the indexing variable is set to a different value in the sequence.  The value of the indexing variable take will go in the same order as the sequence.\n \nSo, if the sequence is 1:5, then:\n\ni will be set to 1 the first time the codeblock cycles\ni will be set to 2 the first time the codeblock cycles\ni will be set to 3 the first time the codeblock cycles\ni will be set to 4 the first time the codeblock cycles\ni will be set to 5 the first time the codeblock cycles\n\n\n\n7.3 Changing the sequence\nThe for loop executes for every value in the sequence, and the index variable takes on the values in order. The values in the sequence do not need to start with 1.\n\n\n\n# Using a sequence that does not start with 1\nfor(i in 12:8) # 12, 11, 10, 9 ,8 (there are five values in the sequence)\n{\n  cat(\"The count is:\", i, \"\\n\");\n}\n\n\nFigure 2: Using a sequence that does not start with 1 in a for loop\n\n\n\nIn this case, the for loop will still execute 5 times, but i will take on values 12 down to 8 instead of 1-5:\nChanging the sequence numbers -- length is still 5:\nThe count is: 12\nThe count is: 11\nThe count is: 10\nThe count is: 9\nThe count is: 8\n\n\n7.4 Indexing variables and more complicated sequence\nYou do not have to name the index i, you can name it whatever you want.  For instance, we will be working with weather so day might be a more appropriate name for the indexing variable.\n \nIn this example we we use a more complicated sequence and change the name of the index variable to day:\n\n\n\nfor(day in seq(from=20, to=2, by=-3))  # 20, 17, 14, 11, 8, 5, 2 (seven values)\n{\n  cat(\"The count is:\", day, \"\\n\");\n}\n\n\nFigure 3: Using a more complicated sequence in a for loop\n\n\n\nUsing a more complicated sequence with seven values:\nThe count is: 20\nThe count is: 17\nThe count is: 14\nThe count is: 11\nThe count is: 8\nThe count is: 5\nThe count is: 2\nSo, in Figure 3, the codeblock cycles 7 times because there are 7 values in the sequence (20, 17, 14, 11, 8, 5, and 2).  Each time the codeblock cycles,  day is set to a different value in the sequence (going from the first value in the sequence to the last).",

The real power comes when you use the indexing variable to index values in a vector – this is how we perform an if-else statement on every value in a vector.\n \nLet’s use the same data we have been using in the previous lessons:\n### read in data from twoWeekWeatherData.csv\nweatherData = read.csv(file=\"data/twoWeekWeatherData.csv\",\n                       sep=\",\",\n                       header=TRUE,\n                       stringsAsFactors = FALSE);\n\n### Extract the highTemps column from the data frame -- save it to a variable\nhighTemps = weatherData$highTemp;\nnoonCond = weatherData$noonCondition;\nSince we want to go through every value in the vector, we need to know the size of the vector.  The easiest way to find the size of a vector is to use the function length():\nnumDays = length(highTemps);  # numDays is 14 (the number of values in highTemps)\nNow let’s use a for loop to output all of the highTemp values.  To do this we use the indexing variable, day, as the index for highTemp:\n\n\n\nfor(day in 1:numDays)  # numDays, in this case, is 14 (sequence is 1:14)\n{\n  cat(highTemp[day], \"\\n\");  # day will take the values 1-14\n}\n\n\nFigure 4: Using the indexing variable as an index for highTemp\n\n\n\nThe 14 values in the vector highTemps in order:\n57\n50\n54\n40\n39\n58\n60\n53\n55\n44\n39\n54\n61\n75\nIn the following example, we use the indexing variable day as both a counter and an index for noonCond:\n\n\n\nfor(day in 1:numDays)\n{\n  cat(day, \") \", noonCond[day], \"\\n\", sep=\"\");\n}\n\n\nFigure 5: Using indexing variable as a counter and an index for noonCond\n\n\n\nUsing indexing variable as a counter and an index for noonCond:\n1) Cloudy\n2) Cloudy\n3) Sunny\n4) Rain\n5) Fog\n6) Sunny\n7) Sunny\n8) Cloudy\n9) Rain\n10) Rain\n11) Snow\n12) Sunny\n13) Sunny\n14) Sunny\n\n8.1 Making code more extensible\nIn the code in Figure 4 and Figure 5,  we already know that the number of values in the vector is 14 so we could just write:\nfor(day in 1:14)\n{\n  cat(highTemp[day], \"\\n\");\n}\nBut this code will only work if the data frame does not change size.  In general, you want to make your code as generic as possible, which means using variables instead of fixed numbers. When you make your code generic, you do not have to change the code when your data changes.  In Figure 4, numDays will automatically adjust to the size of the vector.",

    "text": "12 Application\nMost of the work in this application will be done in your toolbox.r script, but you need to call and test the functions in toolbox.r from you app1-14.r script.\n \n1) Create a script named app1-14.r in your scripts folder.  In that script file, call the toolbox.r script.\n \n2) extend the counter2() function in toolbox.r to include three more conditions:\n\ngreater than or equal to (&gt;=)\nless than or equal to (&lt;=)\nnot equal to (!=)\n\nTest the 3 new conditions in app1-14.r\n \n3) Add an error condition to counter2() if the caller gives an invalid conditional operator value.\nTest the error condition in app1-14.r\n \n4) Create a function in toolbox.r that checks to see if at least one value in a vector is (a) greater than, (b) equal, or (c) less than a given value.\n \nSo, just like counter2(), this new function will take in three arguments:\n\nvector with numeric data\nconditional operator (==, &lt;, or &gt;)\ncomparison value\n\nBut, the function will only return TRUE or FALSE\n\nTRUE if any value in the vector meets the condition\nFALSE if no values in the vector meet the condition\n\nMake sure to test the function from your app1-14.r script.\n \n5) Create a function in toolbox.r that calculates the Mean Square Error (MSE) of a vector (V) of numeric values.\n\\[\nM S E=\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(V_{i}-\\operatorname{mean}(V)\\right)^{2}\n\\]\nA good middle step for this problem is to calculate the mean of the vector using a for loop (i.e., add all the vector values using a for loop and then divide by the length of the vector).\n\n12.1 Tips for question 4\n\nn is the same as the length of the vector\nUse the mean() function to find the mean of the vector.\nCreate a state variable that hold the total value\nUse a for loop to cycle through each value in the vector.  For each value you want to calculate \\(\\left(V_{i}-\\operatorname{mean}(V)\\right)^{2}\\) and add that to the total value\nAfter you get the total, divide it by the length of the vector\n\n \nExample If you have:\nvec = c(8, 11, 9, 4);\nthen the mean(vec) = 8 and\n\\[\nM S E=\\frac{(8-8)^{2}+(11-8)^{2}+(9-8)^{2}+(4-8)^{2}}{4}=6.5\n\\]\nSave the script as app1-14.r in your scripts folder and  email your Project Folder to Charlie Belinsky at belinsky@msu.edu.\n \nInstructions for zipping the Project Folder are here.\n \nIf you have any questions regarding this application, feel free to email them to Charlie Belinsky at belinsky@msu.edu.\n\n\n12.2 Questions to answer\nAnswer the following in comments inside your application script:\n\nWhat was your level of comfort with the lesson/application?\nWhat areas of the lesson/application confused or still confuses you?\nWhat are some things you would like to know more about that is related to, but not covered in, this lesson?",

    "text": "13 Extension: The many arguments in source()\nWhen you look at source() in the Help tab, you can see that source() has many arguments.  If you look more carefully, you can see that all the arguments except two has a default value (file and exprs).   The first without a default value is file, which makes sense because there is no way source() could, by default, guess what file you are calling – a default value would most likely cause a file-not-found error.\n \nexprs is complicated but it is an alternative to file and is ignored if file has a value.\n \nThe rest of the arguments can be used to tweak the way source() operates but they are rarely used.  You can look underneath for a description of all of the arguments – and what the default value means.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The source() function with its many arguments – all but file has a default value\n\n\n\nDefault values allow you to add arguments to a function, making the function more flexible, without increasing the complexity for the user.  The average user can ignore everything except file whereas the advanced user has many more dials that they can tweak.",

    "text": "14 Extension: Checking for invalid values\nOne situation that can occur when checking for conditional operators is that the caller provided an invalid operator.\n \nLet’s say we have the situation:\n\nthe valid operators are: &lt;, &gt;, ==\nthe caller gave the operator: @\n\n \nFirst, we want to create a conditional statement that checks to see if the operator is invalid.  There are two ways to do this.  The first is to check to see if the operator is valid and invert the conditional statement using the ( ! ) operator:\nif( «!(»conditionalOp == \"&gt;\" | conditionalOp == \"&lt;\" | conditionalOp != \"==\"«)» )\n{\n  cat(\"Sorry, \", conditionalOp, \" is not a valid operator\");\n}\nThe conditional statement first checks the inner parentheses.  The or operator ( | ) means inner parentheses will be TRUE if conditionalOp is any of the three operators given.  The not operator ( ! ) inverts that condition to FALSE.  This means the code attached to the if() will be executed only if conditionalOp is not any of the three.\n \nThere is a second way we can write the conditional statement using the and operator ( & ):\nif(conditionalOp «!=» \"&gt;\" «&» conditionalOp «!=» \"&lt;\" & conditionalOp «!=» \"==\")\n{\n  cat(\"Sorry, \", conditionalOp, \" is not a valid operator\");\n}\nThe & operator says that all three conditions must be TRUE in order for the conditional statement to be TRUE.  The three conditions all involve the not equal to operator.  So, the conditional statement is TRUE if conditionalOpis not equal to all the three operators given.\n \nIn mathematical parlance, the two conditional statements above are contrapositives.  In other words, two operations were reversed and the result stays the same.\n \nWe will often first check for invalid values in an if-else structure.  This is because there is no point in making any of the other check if the conditionOp is not valid.\ncounter = function(vector, compareVal, conditionalOp=\"&gt;\")\n{\n  vecLength = length(vector);  # get the length of the vector\n  countVal = 0;                # initialize the count to 0\n  for(val in 1:vecLength)      # go through each value in vector\n  {\n    «if(conditionalOp != \"&gt;\" && conditionalOp != \"&lt;\" && conditionalOp != \"==\")»\n    {\n      cat(\"Sorry, \", conditionalOp, \" is not a valid operator\");\n    }\n    else if(conditionalOp == \"&gt;\" && vector[val] &gt; compareVal)\n    {\n      countVal = countVal + 1; # add one to the count\n    }\n    else if(conditionalOp == \"&lt;\" && vector[val] &lt; compareVal)\n    {\n      countVal = countVal + 1; # add one to the count\n    }\n    else if(conditionalOp == \"==\" && vector[val] == compareVal)\n    {\n      countVal = countVal + 1; # add one to the count\n    }\n  }\n  return(countVal);    # return the count value to the caller\n}",
