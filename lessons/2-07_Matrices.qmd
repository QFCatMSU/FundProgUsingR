### to do

## Purpose

-   Using matrices for 2D data

-   performing math and statistic on a matrix

## Script for the lesson

The [script for the lesson is here](../scripts/2-07_Matrices_new.R)

The [LansingJanTemps.csv](../data/LansingJanTemps.csv)

## CSV files

Let's first look at the CSV file, ***LansingJanTemps.csv***.  The data in the CSV file was downloaded from the NOAA/NCDC website and contains the high temperature for every day in January from 2011 to 2016.

 

A CSV file is a text file that can be read by any text editor.  We can look at the csv file by clicking on it in the ***Files*** tab of RStudio and choosing ***View File***.  The file will open in RStudio's file viewer:

![Opening and viewing a CSV file in RStudio](images/R-2-07-OpenCSV.jpg){#fig-CSVinRStudio .fs}

The temperature values are in tenths of a Celsius degree and the columns have generic names -- we will deal with both of these issues later.

### Saving data to a data frame

Let's open the CSV file and save it to a data frame, named ***lansingJanDF***:

``` r
lansingJanDF = read.csv(file = "data/LansingJanTemps.csv");
```

***lansingJanDF*** is a data frame with 6 columns of January temperatures from the years 2011-2016.  This view of ***lansingJanDF*** is just a more structured view of the data from @fig-CSVinRStudio.

![Viewing the data frame from the CSV file](images/R-2-07-DF.jpg){#fig-dataframe_csv .fs}

### Column name change

Let's create a copy of the data frame so we can maintain the original data frame while making changes:

``` r
lansingJanDF2 = lansingJanDF;
```

We want to change the column names to something that has the years in it. We can change the name of all six columns at once to the six years 2011-2016 using the sequence ***2011:2016***:

``` r
colnames(lansingJanMat2) = 2011:2016;
```

But, [it is not recommended to start a column name with a number]{.hl}.  Column names are essentially variable names and variable names cannot start with a number.  R does allow you to start a column name with a number, but there are problems with this that are beyond the scope of this lesson.

 

To avoid problems, [you should always use variable naming standards for column names in a dataframe]{.hl} even though R does not enforce this.

 

As a reminder, the are that variable names :

-   can only start with a letter, underscore ( \_ ) , or a dot ( . )

    -   [remember: most programming language do not accept dots ( . ) in names]{.note}

-   can consist of letters, numbers, underscore ( \_ ), or a dot ( . )

-   cannot have spaces

-   cannot be reserved words (e.g., ***if***, ***else***, ***TRUE***, ***FALSE***, ***function***, ***for***)

     

We are going to name the columns ***Jan2011***, ***Jan2012***... using ***paste()*** to create the six column names:

``` r
colnames(lansingJanMat2) = paste("Jan", 2011:2016, sep="");
```

[Note: we needed to set sep="", otherwise there would be a space in the name]{.note}

![Changing the column names -- make sure column names follow the same rules as variable names](images/R-2-07-RenameColumns.jpg){#fig-rename_column .fs}

## Data frames and matrices (two-dimensional data)

A data frame is a two dimensional data structure that is a collection of related vectors (i.e., columns). For instance, the ***weatherData*** data frame used in previous lessons had different types of weather data (**columns**) collected every day (**rows**).

 

Data frames, by design, have [columns that hold different types of data]{.hl}.  The weather data from previous lessons had temperature columns, humidity columns, precipitation columns, etc..

 

However, in this lesson, we have a data frame where [all the columns are the same type of value]{.hl} (temperatures) and we will want to perform calculations across rows, columns, and the whole structure.  This cannot be done with a data frame, but it can be done with a matrix.

 

A [matrix]{.hl} is a [two-dimensional vector]{.hl} that is similar to a two-dimensional data frame except that all the columns are the same type of value.

 

We can convert a data frame directly into a matrix using ***as.matrix()***:

``` r
lansingJanMat = as.matrix(lansingJanDF2);
```

In the ***Environment*** tab, the matrix is placed in the ***Data*** section (like a data frame), but is presented as a two-dimensional vector (31 rows by 6 columns):

``` {.r tab="Environment"}
lansingJanMat: num [1:31, 1:6] 122 -39 6 0 -50 -33 ...
```

And, if you double-click on the matrix, it will show up in a ***Viewer*** tab and look like a data frame:

![Matrices and data frame in the Environment -- double-clicking on a matrix opens it in a Viewer tab](images/R-2-07-ViewingMatrix.jpg){#fig-matrixInRStudio .fs}

### Advantages of a matrix

A matrix has two advantages over a data frame:

-   a matrix allows you to perform calculations across rows and the whole structure

-   operations are faster on a matrix than on a data frame

     

If you are dealing with large data that is all of the same type, then it is best to use a matrix.

## Modifying the whole matrix

The temperature data in the ***lansingJanMat*** is in units of tenths of Celsius (this author does not know why NOAA/NCDC chose to store the data this way).  Let's convert this to Fahrenheit.

 

Because this is a matrix, we can execute mathematical operations on all values at once -- just like a vector (remember, a [matrix is a two-dimensional vector]{.hl}).

 

In order, we will:

1.  change the units from tenth of a Celsius to Celsius 

2.  convert the temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit

3.  change values to two significant digits

### Calculations on the whole matrix

We are going to perform three operations on the matrix and show the results of the operations on the first 10 values of the matrix.

 

[Note: I create a new matrices to maintain the old versions of the matrix, but this is not necessary -- you could keep saving the results to ***lansingJanMat***. ]{.note}

 

The first 10 values in the matrix are:

``` {.r tab="Console"}
> lansingJanMat[1:10]
 [1] 122 -39   6   0 -50 -33 -72 -56 -28 -39
```

``` r
# Step 1) Divide by 10 to get units from tenths of Celsius to Celsius
lansingJanMat2 = lansingJanMat / 10;
```

``` {.r tab="Console"}
> lansingJanMat2[1:10]
 [1] 12.2 -3.9  0.6  0.0 -5.0 -3.3 -7.2 -5.6 -2.8 -3.9
```

``` r
# Step 2)  Converting from Celsius to Fahrenheit
lansingJanMat3 = (9/5) * lansingJanMat2 + 32;
```

``` {.r tab="Console"}
> lansingJanMat3[1:10]
 [1] 53.96 24.98 33.08 32.00 23.00 26.06 19.04 21.92 26.96 24.98
```

``` r
# Step 3) Set the number of significant digits to 2
lansingJanMat4 = signif(x=lansingJanMat3, digits=2);
```

::: {#fig-four_matrices}
``` {.r tab="Console"}
> lansingJanMat4[1:10]
 [1] 54 25 33 32 23 26 19 22 27 25
```

### Statistical operation on the whole matrix

We can also apply statistical functions to the whole matrix.  For instance, we can find the mean and standard deviation of all values in the matrix:

``` r
meanAllTemps = mean(lansWeatherMat4);
sdAllTemps = sd(lansingJanMat4);
```

``` {.r tab="Console"}
> meanAllTemps
[1] 29.68495
> sdAllTemps
[1] 10.60749
```

## Subsetting matrices 

If we just want to work with part of the data in a matrix, then we need to subset the matrix.  Similar to the bracket notation, ***\[x\]***, for one-dimensional vectors, we can use two-dimensional bracket ***\[x,y\]*** notation to subset a matrix.

 

In this notation, ***x*** represents the row numbers to subset and ***y*** represents the column numbers to subset.

### Subset a column in a matrix

If ***x*** is not given, it means [take all rows (i.e., do not subset the rows)]{.hl}.  So, the following will find the mean of all rows in column 3 (i.e., all values in the year 2013):

``` r
meanJan2013 = mean(lansWeatherMat[ ,3]);
```

::: {#fig-console_matrix}
``` {.r tab="Console"}
> lansingJanMat4[,3]
 [1] 25 26 29 33 35 35 35 38 45 44 55 58 40 26 29 34 33 35 45 41
[21] 15 10 17 16 20 27 30 43 57 56 27
> meanJan2013
[1] 34.16129
```

:::

### Subset a row in a matrix

If ***y*** is not given, it means [take all columns (i.e., do not subset the columns)]{.hl}.  So, the following will find the mean of all columns in row 17 (i.e., the Jan 17^th^ value for every year):

``` r
meanJan17 = mean(lansWeatherMat[17,]);
```

::: {#fig-matrix_subsetted}
``` {.r tab="Console"}
> lansingJanMat4[17,]
Jan2011 Jan2012 Jan2013 Jan2014 Jan2015 Jan2016 
     30      40      33      30      45      26 
> meanJan17
[1] 34
```

:::

### Subset both rows and columns in a matrix

And you can use sequences for both ***x*** and ***y*** to get a two-dimensional subset of the matrix.  The following will get the mean of the 10^th^ through 19^th^ (Jan 10-19) values of the first three years (2011, 2012, 2013):

``` r
meanJanPart = mean(lansingJanMat4[10:19, 1:3]);
```

::: {#fig-console_matrix_subset}
``` {.r tab="Console"}
> lansingJanMat4[10:19, 1:3]
      Jan2011 Jan2012 Jan2013
 [1,]      25      47      44
 [2,]      26      50      55
 [3,]      27      37      58
 [4,]      25      26      40
 [5,]      23      22      26

 [9,]      34      24      35
[10,]      22      27      45
> meanJanPart
[1] 33.13333
```

### Non-continuous subsetting of rows and column

Finally, you can create more complicated sequences to subset the matrix.  The following will find the mean of all even days on odd years.

 

Since the subsetting is getting complex, it is best to first create variables that hold the subset values:

``` r
  evenDays = seq(from=2, to=31, by=2);
  oddYears = c(1,3,5);  
```

and then use the variables in the bracket notation:

``` r
meanJanEvenOdd = mean(lansingJanMat4[evenDays, oddYears]);
```

::: {#fig-complex_subset}
``` {.r tab="Console"}
> lansingJanMat4[evenDays, oddYears]
      Jan2011 Jan2013 Jan2015
 [1,]      25      26      34
 [2,]      32      33      32
 [3,]      26      35      17
 [4,]      22      38      13

 [6,]      27      58      27
 [7,]      23      26      19
 [8,]      18      34      32

[10,]      23      41      31
[11,]      16      10      30
[12,]      29      16      37
[13,]      29      27      26

[15,]      24      56      23
> meanJanEvenOdd
[1] 29.13333
```

## Reversing the matrix (transpose)

In the previous examples, the rows represent days and the columns represent years.  We could easily reverse the matrix so that the [rows represent the years and the columns represent the days]{.hl}. We do this using the transpose, ***t()***, function:

``` r
lansingJanMat_T = t(lansingJanMat4);
```

The resulting matrix has 6 row and 31 columns with temperature values for the months going horizontally across the matrix instead of vertically down:

![The transpose matrix (reversing the rows and columns)](images/R-2-07-Transpose.jpg){#fig-transpose .fs}

## Statistics across all rows and columns

Earlier, we found the mean of a single column of temperature values (@fig-console_matrix_subset).  Often, we want to find the mean of every column.  We could just repeat the same line 6 times, once for each column:

``` r
meanJan2011 = mean(lansWeatherMat[ ,1]);
meanJan2012 = mean(lansWeatherMat[ ,2]);
...
```

But, this is not an efficient way to code and would become more burdensome as the number of columns increases.

 

There are two better ways to cycle through each column and get the means:

-   Use ***for*** loops

-   Use ***apply()***

### For loops

A ***for*** loop can be used to cycle through, and calculate the mean of, each column in the matrix.  Since there are multiple mean values that you are calculating, you need to save the mean values to one vector.

 

[The vector needs to be created before the **for** loop]{.hl} and assigned values during the ***for*** loop.  After, the ***for*** loop the vector will have the same number of values as the matrix has columns (i.e., 6).

``` r
# vector that holds the 6 yearly mean values
yearlyMean = c();

# cycle through the six column and find the mean of the temperature values
for(i in 1:6) 
{
  # get the mean of all values in column i and save it to yearlyMean[i]
  yearlyMean[i] = mean(lansingJanMat4[,i]);
}
```

The ***yearlyMean*** vector has 6 values, representing the mean for each of the 6 years:

``` {.r tab="Console"}
> yearlyMean
[1] 25.61290 35.77419 34.16129 23.36774 27.45161 31.74194
```

### apply()

***apply()*** is a useful, if somewhat archaic, function in base R that allows you to apply a statistical or mathematical function for every row or column in a matrix.

 

***apply()*** takes three arguments:

-   the matrix you want to perform the function on

-   ***MARGIN***: a number indicating whether you want to perform the action on rows or columns

    -   **1** means all rows, **2** means all columns

-   ***FUN***: the function to apply

 

So, to get the ***mean*** of all columns in the ***lansingJanMat4*** matrix:

``` r
  yearlyMean2 = apply(lansingJanMat4, MARGIN=2, FUN=mean);
```

And, ***yearlyMean2*** is a vector with 6 value, the same as ***yearlyMean*** above.

``` {.r tab="Console"}
> yearlyMean2
 Jan2011  Jan2012  Jan2013  Jan2014  Jan2015  Jan2016 
25.61290 35.77419 34.16129 23.36774 27.45161 31.74194 
```

***yearlyMean2*** is formatted differently than ***yearlyMean*** -- ***yearlyMean2*** is a ***named*** variable.  The distinction is something we will look more into in the lesson on Objects in R.

## Saving the matrix

We are going to save ***lansingJanMat4*** to a CSV files so we can use it in the next lesson and avoid the hassle of reformatting the original CSV file:

``` r
write.csv(x=lansWeatherMat, file = "data/LansingJanTempsFixed.csv",    
          row.names = FALSE);
```

This will put a CSV file named ***LansingJanTempsFixed.csv*** in the ***data*** folder of your Project Folder.

## Application

1\) You are given a data frame with three columns:

-   average temperature

-   maximum temperature

-   minimum temperature

     

Is it best to convert the data frame into matrix?  In comments in your application script give 1 reason why it is best to convert and one reason why it is not.

 

2\) Find:

-   the minimum (***min()***) temperature value in January 2013

-   the maximum (***max()***) temperature value in January 2013

-   the minimum (***min()***) temperature value on January 14^th^

-   the maximum (***max()***) temperature value in January 14^th^

     

3\) Using ***for*** loops, find the mean value for each day in January (i.e., mean of the rows)

 

4\) Using ***apply()***, find the mean value for each day in January (i.e., mean of the rows)

 

5\) Find the mean temperature of every 4th day in the years 2011, 2014, and 2016.

 

6\) Convert the temperature matrix so that it show how many degrees the temperature was above or below freezing on the Fahrenheit scale.  So, 25 would become -7,  and 60 would become 38.

## Extension: dataframes and tibbles

In March 2019, the line of code to get a column of temperature values from the ***lansWeather11Data*** dataframe (and the other 5 years) changed from

``` r
lansWeather11Val = lansWeather11Data [, "value"];
```

to

``` r
lansWeather11Val = lansWeather11Data$value;
```

The reason for this change is that the NOAA/NCDC database starting sending data in tibbles instead of dataframes.  Tibbles are designed to be a more modern take on the dataframe, basically taking the lessons from decades on dataframe usage to create a better dataframe.

 

Tibbles are essentially the tidyverse version of a data frame and they supposedly improve on the data frame.

 

But, one difference is that in a data frame the three following lines all function exactly the same – they each take the column ***value*** from the data frame ***lw11Data*** and save it to a vector called ***temps***:

``` r
temps=lw11Data$value
temps=lw11Data[, "value"]
temps=lw11Data[["value"]]
```

However, in a tibble, the following line saves the column ***value*** into [a new 1 column tibble]{.hl} called ***temps***.

``` r
temps=lw11Data[,"value"]
```

In other words, ***temps*** is not a vector, hence the error.

 

These two lines work the same in tibbles and data frames:

``` r
temps=lw11Data$value
temps=lw11Data[[“value”]]
```
