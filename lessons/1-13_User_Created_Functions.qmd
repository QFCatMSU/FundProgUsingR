## Four structures in programming

Once again, there are basically 4 main structures that cover almost every aspect of programming:

1.  Variables

2.  If-Else Statements

3.  For Loops

4.  Functions

 

And now we have reached the last structure: functions, which we will cover in the next few lessons. Functions allow you to write code once and reuse it as opposed to writing the same code multiple times. 

## Reusable scripts

Functions are self-contained codeblocks that performs a common task. For example, there are statistical functions that take a vector of values and return the statistical value (e.g., ***mean()*** and ***median()***), functions that take data and create plots (e.g., ***plot(), boxplot()***), and functions that interact with the ***Console*** (e.g., ***cat()*** and ***print()***). The functions listed above are come with R and are designed to be used in any script.

 

Broadly, there are three types of functions in R:

1\) Base-R: these are function that come with R (e.g., ***mean(), median(), boxplot(), cat()***)

-   We covered these in lesson 1-05, and there is more here: [Extension: The R-base mean() function](#sec-r-base-mean)

2\) Packages: extensions of R (e.g., ***ggplot2***, ***tidyverse*** – covered later in class)

3\) User-created: the main focus of the next few lessons

## Using a function script

There are two script files in this lesson:

-   ***1-13_Functions_Only.R***: This script contains only user-generated functions

-   ***1-13_Functions_Main.R***: The main script that makes use of the functions in ***1-13_Functions_Only.R***

So far we have used base-R functions. Now we are going to create our own (user-generated) functions. In general user-created functions are put in a separate script. This is done so that the functions can be used by multiple scripts, just like base-R functions can be used by any script.

 

Because the functions are in a separate script, we must first read (***source***) the functions script from the main script before we can use the functions:

 

This line in ***1-13_Functions_Main.R*** executes all code within the script ***1-13_Functions_Only.R*** (assuming it is in the ***scripts*** folder inside your project folder):

``` r
source("scripts/1-13_Functions_Only.R");
```

R will put the three functions from ***1-13_Functions_Only.R*** into the ***Environment***:

``` {.r tab="Environment"}
hello_you:   function (who, feeling_good = TRUE)
mean_advanced:    function (vec, removeNA = FALSE)
mean_simple:  function (vec)
```

Functions, like variables, are named objects that store information. The difference is that [variables store values]{.hl} whereas [functions store script]{.hl}. User-generated functions must be in the ***Environment*** before they can be used.

### Clearing the Environment

In all the precious lessons, every script includes this code at the top:

``` r
 rm(list=ls())
```

The purpose of this code is to clear out your ***Environment*** so that your script has a clean slate. In reality, it is to force programmers to include all the resources they need to run a script inside the script they are running (i.e., make the script self-contained). However, function scripts are resources for the main script and calling `rm(list=ls())` from the function script would clear the ***Environment*** of variables declared in the main script. [A function script should never clear the Environment]{.hl}.

## Function components

All functions, whether base-R, in packages, or user-created, have the same four components: **name**, **arguments**, ***codeblock***, and **return value**. 

 

Let's start with the simplest function in ***1-13_Functions_Only.R***. This function is named ***hello_you()***, has two arguments: ***who*** and ***feeling_good***, and returns ***msg*** to the caller.

``` {.r tag="1-13_Functions_Only.R"}
«hello_you» = function(«who», «feeling_good»=TRUE)
{ # start codeblock
  msg = paste0("Hello, ", who)
  
  if(feeling_good == FALSE)
  {
    msg = paste0(msg, ", I'm sorry you are not feeling well today!")
  }
  
  return(«msg»);
} # end codeblock
```

[note: when referring to a function name, we usually add **( )** to differentiate it from a variable]{.note}

### function codeblock

Functions, just like ***if()*** and ***for()***, have codeblocks attached to them that are executed when the function is called. The codeblock is encapsulated with curly brackets **{ }**.

 

A function codeblock operates like any other R code with two exceptions:

-   The arguments in the function call (e.g., ***who*** and ***feeling_good***) are variables used in the codeblock.

-   Functions usually return a value (e.g., ***msg***) to the caller using ***return()***.

### Setting argument values

***hello_you()*** is in the Environment so we can now call it in ***1-13_Functions_Main.R***. Let's first call the function using only the ***who*** argument:

``` {.r tag="1-13_Functions_Main.R"}
hi1 = hello_you("Bob");
hi2 = hello_you(who="Charlie");
```

``` {.r tab="Environment"}
hi1: "Hello, Bob"
hi2: "Hello, Charlie"
```

Since ***who*** is the first argument in ***hello_you()***, R assumes the first value (i.e., "Bob"), if unnamed, is for the first argument . We can also explicitly name the argument (i.e., ***who***="Charlie").

 

In both cases, the function call is assigned to a variable (***hi1***, ***hi2***). This means that [the return value of the function is assigned to the variable]{.hl} (e.g., ***msg***).

 

[Note: if ***hello_you()*** is in the ***Environment***, then you can also call it in the ***Console***:]{.note}

``` {.r tab="Console"}
> hello_you("Brad")
[1] "Hello, Brad"
> hello_you(who="Chuck")
[1] "Hello, Chuck"
```

In this case, the return value, ***msg***, in outputted to the ***Console***

### Default values

Most functions in R have default values for some of the argument. In ***hello_you()***, ***feeling_good*** has the default value of ***TRUE***. The caller must provide values for arguments that do not have default values and functions often have numerous arguments. In order to avoid overwhelming the caller, default values are provided for most arguments.

 

Looking at the ***Help*** for ***boxplot()***, we see that the **Default S3 Method** has many arguments but all of them, except ***x***, has a default value. ***x*** is the data and the rest of the argument are tweaks to the function.

``` r
## Default S3 method:
boxplot(«x», ..., range = 1.5, width = NULL, varwidth = FALSE,
        notch = FALSE, outline = TRUE, names, plot = TRUE,
        border = par("fg"), col = "lightgray", log = "",
        pars = list(boxwex = 0.8, staplewex = 0.5, outwex = 0.5),
         ann = !add, horizontal = FALSE, add = FALSE, at = NULL)
```

### Changing default values

Default values are generally what the programmer consider to be the most common values for the argument. In the case of ***hello_you()***, we are assuming that the majority of people are feeling good so the the default value is ***TRUE***.

 

If someone is not feeling good, they change the value for the ***feeling_good*** argument:

`{.r 1-13_Functions_Main.R=""} hi3 = hello_you("David", feeling_good=FALSE); hi4 = hello_you(who="Evelyn", feeling_good=FALSE); hi5 = hello_you("Frank", FALSE); hi6 = hello_you(feeling_good=FALSE, who="George");`

``` {.r tab="Environment"}
hi3: "Hello, David, I'm sorry you are not feeling well today!"
hi4: "Hello, Evelyn, I'm sorry you are not feeling well today!"
hi5: "Hello, Frank, I'm sorry you are not feeling well today!"
hi6: "Hello, George, I'm sorry you are not feeling well today!"
```

[note: the caller could set ***feeling_good*** to ***TRUE***. It does not change the argument value but it makes the function call more explicit.]{.note}

### Argument order

In our last example, every function call uses both arguments: ***who*** and ***feeling_good***. The argument names are not needed if the arguments are presented in the same order as given in the function:

``` r
hi5 = hello_you("Frank", FALSE);
```

On the flip side, using all argument names makes the function call more readable and you do not have to worry about order:

``` r
hi4 = hello_you(who="Evelyn", feeling_good=FALSE);
hi6 = hello_you(feeling_good=FALSE, who="George");
```

For many R functions, the first argument is the data, and often left unnamed, whereas the rest of the arguments are typically named:

``` r
hi3 = hello_you("David", feeling_good=FALSE);
```

In general, I would argue that arguments beyond the first should be named for readability – especially when you have functions with many arguments.

## Function header

The other two functions in ***1-13_Functions_Only.R*** calculate the mean of a vector.

 

The four components of two mean functions are:

-   **name**: ***mean_simple()*** and ***mean_advanced()***

-   **arguments**:

    -   ***mean_simple()*** has one: ***vec***

    -   ***mean_advanced()*** has two: ***vec*** and ***removeNA***

-   **codeblock**: everything between ( **{** ) and ( **}** ) -- this is the code that gets executed when the function is called

-   **return value**: both functions return the mean value using ***return()***

## Using the mean functions

In the ***Environment***, we see that ***mean_simple()*** has one argument, ***vec***, that does not have a default value.

 

***mean_simple()*** solves for the mean by cycling through all the values in ***vec*** using a ***for*** loop, adds the values, and then divides that by the number of values in ***vec***.

``` {.r tab="1-13_Functions_Only.R"}
mean_simple = function(«vec»)
{
  vecAdded = 0; ### state variable -- starts at 0

  ### Use the for loop to cycle through all the values in vec and add them to vecAdded
  for(i in 1:length(«vec»))
  {
    ### Adds the next value in vec
    vecAdded = vecAdded + «vec»[i];
  }

  ### Divide the total value by the number of values to get the mean
  meanVal = vecAdded / length(«vec»);

  ### return the mean value to the caller
  return(«meanVal»);
} 
```

### Return value

From the caller's perspective, a function takes arguments as input and returns a values as output. The return value is sent to the caller using the function ***return()***:

``` r
return(meanVal);
```

When the caller calls the function, they often set a variable equal to the function (e.g., ***retVal*** in the code below). The return value is stored in the variable set equal to the function:

``` {.r tab="1-13_Functions_Main.R"}
meanSimp1 = mean_simple(c(3,5,2,7));  # saves the return value (4.25) to the variable retVal
```

### Calling the function

We will call ***mean_simple()*** multiple times and save the results to four different variables:

``` {.r tab="1-13_Functions_Main.R"}
meanSimp1 = mean_simple(vec=c(6,2,8,3));        # 4.75
# meanSimp2 = mean_simple();                    # error because argument not provided
meanSimp3 = mean_simple(vec=c(6,2, NA, 8,3));   # NA_Real because of the NA 
meanSimp4 = mean_simple(vec=c(6,2,8,3,75,200)); # 49
anotherVec = c(7, -7, 10, -8);
meanSimp5 = mean_simple(vec=anotherVec);        # can use a predefined vector
```

Each call to the function ***mean()*** passes in a vector of values for the ***vec*** argument and saves the return value to a variable (***ret2a***, ***ret2b***...). In the ***Environment*** we can see the return values stored in the variables.

``` {.r tab="Environment"}
meanSimp1: 4.75 
meanSimp2: NA_real_
meanSimp3: 49
meanSimp4: 1
```

[note: the mean value of a vector with ***NA*** values is ***NA***.]{.note} This is similar to ***median()*** in lesson 1-05. More about that here: [Extension: The R-base mean() function](#sec-r-base-mean)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## mean_advanced

Just like ***mean_simple()***, the function, ***mean_advanced()*** solves for the mean by going through all the values in the caller-supplied vector, adding them up, and then dividing that answer by the number of values in ***vec***. The difference is that ***mean_advanced()*** checks for ***NA*** values and gives the caller the option to remove them.

### Header line of a function

The header for ***mean_advanced()*** looks similar to ***mean_simple()*** except there is a second argument, ***removeNA***, and this argument has a default value of **FALSE**. This means if the caller does not set ***removeNA***, it will be **FALSE** (i.e., ***NA*** values will **not** be removed).

``` r
mean_advanced = function(vec, removeNA = FALSE)
```

### Codeblock {#sec-mean_adv_code}

In the codeblock attached to ***mean_advanced()***, we need to conditionally handle the situation where ***NA*** values are to be removed, based on the value of the argument ***removeNA***. We do this using an `if-else-if` structure inside the `for` loop.

``` {.r tab="1-13_Functions_Only.R"}
mean_advanced = function(vec, removeNA = FALSE)
{
  vecAdded = 0; ### state variable -- starts at 0
  numNA = 0;    ### second state variable that counts the number of NA values

  ### Use the for loop to cycle through all the values in vec and add them to vecAdded
  for(i in 1:length(vec))
  {
    if(is.na(vec[i]) == FALSE)  ### If the value is not NA
    {
      ### Adds the next value in vec
      vecAdded = vecAdded + vec[i];

    }else if (removeNA == TRUE)   ## we have a NA value and want to remove it
    {
      ### Don't add the value, instead increase the number of NA by 1
      numNA = numNA +1;
    
    }else if (removeNA == FALSE)  ## we have a NA value and don't want to remove it
    {
      ### We cannot solve for a mean with an NA so the return value has to be NA
      return(NA_real_);  # return() ends the function -- just like break() ends a for loop
    }
  }

  ### Divide the total value by the number of values that are not NA to get the mean
  meanVal = vecAdded / ( length(vec) - numNA);

  ### return the mean value to the caller
  return(meanVal);
}
```

There are three possible situations, hence three parts to the ***if-else-if*** structure:

1.  `if(is.na(vec[i]) == FALSE)  # The current vec value is not NA`
    -   The ***i***^th^ value is not ***NA*** (i.e., it's a number), so add the number to the total
2.  `else if (removeNA == TRUE)  # We have a NA value and want to remove it`
    -   ignore the ***NA*** value and add 1 to the number of ***NA*** values
3.  `else if (removeNA == FALSE) # We have a NA value and don't want to remove it`
    -   at this point, we know the return value has to be ***NA*** – so return ***NA***

### return() ends the function

Just like ***break*** immediately ends a ***for*** loop, [***return()*** immediately ends a function]{.hl}.

 

There are two ***return()*** statements in this function:

1.  Once an ***NA*** value is hit, and the caller did not ask for ***NA*** values to be removed. At this point we know the answer is ***NA***. There is no point in checking any more values in the vector. We put a ***return()*** to end the function and pass ***NA*** back to the caller

2.  At the end of the codeblock after the ***for*** loop cycles through all the values in the vector.

 

Since `return()` ends a function, only one `return()` can be executed per function call.

### Using the function

``` {.r tab="1-13_Functions_Script.R"}
meanAdv1 = mean_advanced(vec=c(6,2,8,3));       # 4.75
# meanAdv2 = mean_advanced();                   # will cause error because argument not provided 
meanAdv3 = mean_advanced(vec=c(6,2, NA, 8,3));  # will be NA (removeNA default is FALSE)
meanAdv4 = mean_advanced(vec=c(6,2, NA, 8,3), removeNA = TRUE);  # 4.75
meanAdv5 = mean_advanced(vec=c(6,2,8,3, 75,200)); # 49
```

Each line of code above calls the function ***mean_advanced()***, passes in values for one or more arguments, and saves the return value from the function to a variable (***ret3a***, ***ret3b***...). In the ***Environment*** we can see the return values stored in the variables.

``` {.r tab="Environment"}
meanAdv1:  4.75 
meanAdv3:  NA_real_
meanAdv4:  4.75
meanAdv5:  49
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Application

1\) For this application you need to...

a.  Create two scripts:

    -   a functions script named ***app1-13_functions.r*** that contains the functions created in this application

    -   a main script named ***app1-13.r*** where you will answer questions in comments and test the functions created in ***app1-13_functions.r***

b.  ***source()*** your functions script from the main script

c.  [Make sure you thoroughly test all the functions you create in your main script.]{.hl} I want to see the test code in ***app1-13.r***.

 

2\) For the function ***mean_advanced()***, answer the following questions in comments in the main script:

a.  Why do we count the number of ***NA***s?

b.  For the two ***else if*** statements, what assumption can be made about the ***i***^th^ value being checked? Why can we make this assumption?

c.  Why does ***removeNA*** have a default value but ***vec*** does not?

d.  Under what circumstances, if any, will this line ***not*** be executed?

``` r
meanVal = vecAdded / ( length(vec) - numNA);
```

3\) Create a function that returns either the standard deviation (default) or variance of a vector:

-   There should be two arguments: (1) the vector and (2) something that allows the caller choose whether they want the standard deviation or the variance of the vector.

-   Do not use ***var()*** or ***sd()*** – use your own formula. You can use the code from the application in lesson 1-03 as a starting point.

 

4\) Create a function that converts a temperature from either Celsius to Fahrenheit (default) or Fahrenheit to Celsius

-   The conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit is: $F=\frac{9}{5} C+32$

-   The user needs to pass in two arguments: (1) the temperature value and (2) which direction they want to convert

 

5\) Create a function that takes a single number from 0 to 100 and returns a grade from A to F. 

-   Return an error if the number is less than 0 and return a different error if the number is greater than 100.

 

6\) Create a function that takes a vector of numbers and returns the percentage of values that are above 60.

-   Have the function ignore values less than 0 or greater than 100

-   Test the function with 25 random numbers from -20 to 120

    -   `sample(-20:120, size=25);`

{{< include ../assets/_AppInstructions.qmd >}}

## Extension: Functions without arguments

Most of the time you need to include arguments when you call a function.

 

There are exceptions. For instance ***c()***, which creates a vector, is often used without an argument, which means the vector initially has no values (i.e., a ***NULL*** vector):

``` r
vec1 = c();         # a vector that initially has no values (an empty vector) 
vec2 = c(5,2,9,1);  # a vector with four values
```

``` {.r tab="Environment"}
vec1: NULL
vec2: num [1:4] 5 2 9 1
```

You could also call ***cat()*** without any arguments, and R will display nothing:

``` {.r tab="Console"}
> cat()
> 
```

***date()*** is a simple enough function that you do not need any arguments:

``` {.r tab="Console"}
> date()
[1] "Fri Sep 19 10:17:29 2025"
```

## Extension: The R-base mean() function {#sec-r-base-mean}

For a little refresher of R-base functions and their components, let's look at the built-in R function ***mean()***. When calling a function, there are three things the caller must know: name, arguments, and return value. The ***Help*** tab for a function gives these:

![Name, arguments, and return value for the function mean() in the Help tab](images/clipboard-662320927.png){#fig-meanFunction .fs}

### Name

Functions, like variables, are named objects that stores information.  The difference is that [variables store values]{.hl} whereas [functions store script]{.hl}.

 

The name of the function in @fig-meanFunction is ***mean()***. When referring to a function, we often put parentheses after the name to indicate that this object is a function, not a variable.

### Arguments (inputs to a function)

[Arguments are variables]{.hl} whose values are supplied by the caller and used by the function.

 

In the ***Help*** tab (@fig-meanFunction) we see that the ***Default S3 Method*** (the most commonly used method) for ***mean()*** has three arguments (***x***, ***trim***, ***na.rm***).

``` r
mean(x, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE, ...)
```

In this case, ***x*** is the vector of values that the caller want to find the mean for. [Note: ***x*** is often used by R as a generic argument for input values.]{.note}

 

The other two arguments, ***trim*** and ***na.rm***, are tweaks to ***mean()*** that give ***mean()*** more functionality. ***trim*** can be used to remove extreme values and ***na.rm*** can be used to ignore **NA** values. ***trim*** and ***na.rm*** have [default values]{.hl} `(trim = 0, na.rm= FALSE)` meaning the caller does not need to provide values for these arguments unless they want to change the default functionality of ***mean()***.

 

[Extension: Functions without arguments]

### Return value (output of a function)

When a caller calls a function, they usually expect to get some information back from the function. In the case of ***mean()***, the caller is expecting the mean value of the vector provided as an argument. The ***Value*** section of @fig-meanFunction gives information about what the function is returning to the caller. ***mean()*** returns a [length-one object]{.hl}.

 

In other words, the return value from ***mean()*** is one value: the mean.

### Using a function

We will call ***mean()*** multiple times with the same vector of values but changing the arguments. One value in the vector is ***NA***, which we need to deal with because the mean of any vector with an ***NA*** value is ***NA***. [Note: this was covered in more detail in [lesson 5 with ***median()***](1-05_Functions_Introduction.html#sec-median-NA).]{.note}

 

There are four calls below to the function ***mean()***. Each call passes in one or more argument value, and saves the return value from the function to the variables named ***meanBase1***, ***meanBase2***, ***meanBase3***, and ***meanBase4***.

``` {.r tab="1-13_Functions_Main.R"}
testVector = c(10, 15, 5, NA, -100, 10); # has an NA value
meanBase1 = mean(x=testVector);               # uses default for na.rm, which is FALSE
meanBase2 = mean(x=testVector, na.rm=FALSE);  # same as above
meanBase3 = mean(x=testVector, na.rm=TRUE);   # remove NAs
meanBase4 = mean(x=testVector, na.rm=TRUE, trim=0.1);  # remove NAs and trims high and low value
```

In the ***Environment*** we can see the return values stored in the variables.

``` {.r tab="Environment"}
meanBase1: NA_real_ 
meanBase2: NA_real_ 
meanBase3: -12 
meanBase4: 10
```

-   ***meanBase1*** and ***meanBase2*** are ***NA_real*** because there was an unignored ***NA*** value in the vector and we did not choose to remove the ***NA***. [note: ***NA_real\_*** means the value is ***NA*** but would be a real number if it was not ***NA***.]{.note}

-   ***meanBase3*** is **-12**, the mean of the values when the ***NA*** is removed

-   ***meanBase4*** is **10**, the mean of the values when the high (15) and low (-100) values are also removed. [Note: trim=0.1 means trim top and bottom 10%.]{.note}
