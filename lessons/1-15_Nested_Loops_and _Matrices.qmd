## Functions within a script

In the previous two lessons, we created a separate script for the functions used in the lesson. For this lesson, the function ***isPrime3()*** has been put inside the main script. It is not usually best practice to put functions inside the calling script (why this is true is an application question). However, there are many occasions where you will see functions put directly inside a script, so it is good to be familiar with this practice.

### functions need to be declared

Functions are like variables in that they store information to a named objects – and objects must be declared before they are used. If you are going to code a function directly in the script that calls the function then [you need to declare the function before you call the function]{.hl}.

## Nesting for loops: isPrime3()

In the [previous lesson's function script](../scripts/1-14_myFunctions.R), the function ***isPrime2()***, has a ***for*** loop that cycles through all of the possible divisors for the dividend given by the caller. If none of the modulus calculations are zero (i.e., every division has a remainder), then we know the dividend is prime. ***isPrime3()*** extends ***isPrime2()*** so that it can check multiple dividends for prime instead of one.

 

This means we need nested ***for*** loops (***for*** loops inside of ***for*** loops). The outer ***for*** loop cycles through each of the dividends and the inner ***for*** loop cycles though all the possible divisors for the specific dividend:

``` r
for(each dividend we want to check)         # outer loop
{
  for(each divisor of the current dividend) # inner loop
  {
    
  }
}
```

### Examples of isPrime3() {#sec-example}

Before we look at the code, let's look at an example of its use:

``` r
primeTest1 = isPrime3(c(12,13,14,15,16,17));
```

In the ***Environment***, ***primeTest1***, which stored the return value, is called a ***Named logi***.

``` {.r tab="Environment"}
primeTest1: Named logi [1:6] FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE
```

***logi*** means the vector values are Boolean and ***Named*** means the individual vector values are named. You cannot see the names in the ***Environment*** but you can in the ***Console***:

``` {.r tab="Console"}
> primeTest1    
   12    13    14    15    16    17  
FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE 
```

The names are the same as the dividend values passed in by the caller. How this is done will be shown later in this lesson.

 

One advantage to ***Named*** variables is that you can index the vector by either name or position:

``` {.r tab="Environment"}
> primeTest1["14"]
   14 
FALSE 
> primeTest1[3]
   14 
FALSE
```

## Nested for loops

***isPrime3()*** has two ***for*** loops:

-   outer loop: indexes through the range of ***dividends*** supplied by the caller

-   inner loop: indexes through the range of divisors that will be used to check the dividend for prime

    -   like last lesson, the range will be from 2 to one less than the dividend

### Outer loop

The job of the outer loop is cycle through each ***dividends***. The index value, ***i***, determines the current dividend, indexed from the ***dividends*** vector. The current dividend gets used inside the inner ***for*** loop.

 

In the example above (@sec-example),

primeNum\[1\] = 12;

primeNum\[2\] = 13;

...

primeNum\[6\] = 17;

``` r
  «for(i in 1:length(dividends))»   
  {     
    primeNum[i] = TRUE;
     
    for(j in 2:(dividends[«i»]-1))     
    {      
      if(dividends[«i»] %% j == 0)       
      {         
        primeNum[«i»] = FALSE;       
      }     
    }   
  «}»
```

### Inner loop

***isPrime2()*** uses a ***for*** loop to check all the possible divisors for the dividend. That ***for*** loop is now the inner ***for*** loop in ***isPrime3()***. The inner ***for*** loop cycles through every single value from 2 to one less that the current dividend, except the index variable is now ***j,*** because ***i*** was used by the outer loop.

``` r
  for(i in 1:length(dividends))   
  {  
     primeNum[i] = TRUE;
     
    «for(j in 2:(dividends[i]-1))»  # 2 to one less than current dividend  
    «{»       
      if(dividends[i] %% «j» == 0)       
      {         
        primeNum[i] = FALSE;       
      }     
    «}»   
  }
```

The return value needs to specify if each dividend is prime (***TRUE***) or not (***FALSE***). This means a vector of Boolean values needs to be set and returned to the caller so the return vector returned has the same number of values as the vector ***dividends***.

### Set up the return value

The function returns a Boolean vector to the caller that is the same length as ***dividends*** passed in by the caller. The return vector is created in the first line of the function:

``` r
primeNum = c();
```

Like before, we assume that the dividend is prime until proven otherwise, so at the beginning of the outer ***for*** loop, we set the current ***primeNum*** to **TRUE**:

``` r
primeNum[i] = TRUE;
```

The inner ***for*** loop goes through all possible divisors. If one of the divisors divides the dividend evenly then the dividend is not prime and then switches the single value in the vector ***primeNum*** to **FALSE**.

``` r
primeNum[i] = FALSE;
```

``` r
isPrime3 = function(dividends)
{
  «primeNum = c();»
  
  for(i in 1:length(dividends))   # outer loop
  {
    «primeNum[i] = TRUE;»  # default is that dividend is prime
    
    for(j in 2:(dividends[i]-1))  # inner loop
    {
      if(dividends[i] %% j == 0)  # i from outer loop indexing dividends
      {
        «primeNum[i] = FALSE;»  # dividend not be prime
      }
    }
  }
  names(primeNum) = dividends;
  «return(primeNum);»
}
```

### Return named vector

If we just returned ***primeNum*** to the caller, the return would be a Boolean vector that can be indexed by position only.

 

It order to make the return value more readable to the caller, we attached names to each vector value. Since the caller want to know the prime status of each dividend, it makes sense to name the return with the dividend values:

``` r
names(primeNum) = dividends;
```

In the end, we return ***primeNum*** back to the caller and ***primeNum*** gets save to the variable the caller set equal to the function:

``` r
return(primeNum);
```

### Console Examples

We can call the function ***isPrime3()*** from within the script, as before (@sec-example), or from the ***Console***:

``` {.r tab="Console"}
> isPrime3(30:39)
   30    31    32    33    34    35    36    37    38    39 
FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE 
> isPrime3(seq(from=17, to=57, by=10)) 
   17    27    37    47    57 
 TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE 
```

If `names(primeNum) = dividends;` was taken out of the function then the return values would look like this:

``` {.r tab="Console"}
> isPrime3(30:39)
 [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE
> isPrime3(seq(from=17, to=57, by=10)) 
[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
```

## Two-dimensional vectors

One of the more natural uses of nested ***for*** loops in R is the creation of two-dimensional vectors, also called a [matrix]{.hl}.

### What is a matrix

A matrix is somewhat of a cross between a vector and a data frame. A matrix has rows and columns like a data frame. However, like a vector, all values in a matrix are of the same type. This means that calculations on a matrix can be applied to all values as opposed to just one column. We will talk more about the use of matrices in a later lesson.

### Matrix creation

Just like ***c()*** is used to create a vector, ***matrix()*** isused to create a matrix, with the arguments ***nrow*** and ***ncol*** giving the dimensions of the matrix.

 

We can create an empty matrix:

``` r
> matrix(nrow=4, ncol=3)
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]   NA   NA   NA
[2,]   NA   NA   NA
[3,]   NA   NA   NA
[4,]   NA   NA   NA
```

Or fill the matrix with values:

``` {.r tab="Console"}
> matrix(data=1:12, nrow=4, ncol=3)
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    5    9
[2,]    2    6   10
[3,]    3    7   11
[4,]    4    8   12
```

### Subsetting a matrix

Let's save the matrix as the variable, ***testMatrix***, so that we can use the matrix:

``` r
> testMatrix = matrix(data=1:12, nrow=4, ncol=3)
```

To get a specific value from the matrix, you need two values, a row and a column:

``` r
> testMatrix[1,2]
[1] 5
> testMatrix[3,1]
[1] 3
> testMatrix[4,3]
[1] 12
```

You can get a whole row by leaving the column blank and a whole column by leaving the row blank:

``` r
> testMatrix[3,]
[1] 3  7 11
> testMatrix[,2]
[1] 5 6 7 8
```

### Matrices are often all combinations of two factors

One common use of a matrix is to create a table the contains every combination of two factors. For instance, we can have a vector of temperature values and a vector of humidity values and create a heat index matrix for every temperature/humidity combination:

 

![Heat index table from NOAA](images/1-15_HeatIndexTable.jpg){.fs}

## Multiplication table

We will start with a simpler example: a multiplication table. For this table we will have two numeric vectors and populate the matrix with every possible multiplication between values in the two vectors:

|       | 1   | 2   | 3   |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|
| **1** | 1   | 2   | 3   |
| **2** | 2   | 4   | 6   |
| **3** | 3   | 6   | 9   |
| **4** | 4   | 8   | 12  |
| **5** | 5   | 10  | 15  |

### Setting up the matrix

First we need our numeric vectors:

``` r
### Factors for multiplication table
mult1 = 2:6;
mult2 = 8:10;
```

Then we need to create an empty matrix that has the correct number of rows and columns – given by the lengths of ***mult1*** and ***mult2***:

``` r
### Create a matrix that will contain the calculations
multTable = matrix(nrow=length(mult1),
                   ncol=length(mult2));
```

### Using nested for loops to fill matrix {#sec-mult-matrix}

We use nested ***for*** loops to cycle through every possible combination of ***mult1*** and ***mult2***.

 

The outer loop cycles through ***mult1*** and the inner loop cycles through ***mult2***:

``` r
for(i in 1:length(mult1))   # outer loop (for each mult1)
{
  for(j in 1:length(mult2)) # inner loop (for each mult2)
  {
    # The [i,j] cell get set to the multiplication of the corresponding i and j values
    multTable[i,j] = mult1[i] * mult2[j];  
  }
}
```

The calculations go in this order:

2\*8, 2\*9, 2\*10, 3\*8, 3\*9, 3\*10, 4\*8, 4\*9, 4\*10, 5\*8, 5\*9, 5\*10, 6\*8, 6\*9, 6\*10.

 

Aside from cycling through values, the only code is this line:

``` r
multTable[i,j] = mult1[i] * mult2[j]; 
```

***multTable*** is a 2D matrix and needs 2 values to subset it (***i*** and ***j***). The `[i, j]` spot in the matrix gets populated the ***i^th^*** value of ***mult1*** multiplied by the ***j^th^*** value of ***mult2***.

### Naming rows and columns

After we execute the for loop, we have a matrix that looks like this:

``` r
> multTable
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]   16   18   20
[2,]   24   27   30
[3,]   32   36   40
[4,]   40   45   50
[5,]   48   54   60
```

Let's make the matrix more visually informative by naming the rows and columns to the values in `mult1` and `mult2`:

``` r
rownames(multTable) = mult1;
colnames(multTable) = mult2;
```

Now we get something that's easier to read:

::: {#fig-mult-table-ex}
``` r
> multTable
   8  9 10
2 16 18 20
3 24 27 30
4 32 36 40
5 40 45 50
6 48 54 60
```
:::

and can use the names to refer to rows and columns:

``` r
> multTable["4", "10"]
[1] 40
> multTable["2", "9"]
[1] 18
```

### Indexing named numeric values

Rownames and column names are always characters – this is why the values are in quotes. Numeric value are used to index rows and columns.

-   `multTable[4, 10]` is the value in row 4 and column 10, which does not exist so this would be an error.

-   `multTable["4", "10"]` is the value in the row named "4" and column named "10"

## Wind Chill Matrix

We will do a slightly more complicated matrix that combines temperature values and wind speed values to create a wind chill matrix

### Matrix setup {#sec-example_windchill}

We first need our temperature and wind speed values. This time we will use sequences that gives every 10^th^ value:

``` r
temps = seq(from=40, to=-20, by=-10); # 40, 30, 20...
speeds = seq(from=5, to=45, by=10);   # 5, 15, 25 ...
```

And create a matrix that has the correct number of rows and columns based on the length of ***temps*** and ***speeds***:

``` r
windChillTable = matrix(nrow=length(temps),
                        ncol=length(speeds));
```

Finally, we will add row names and column names to make the matrix easier to read:

``` r
rownames(windChillTable) = temps;
colnames(windChillTable) = speeds;
```

### changing index names in nested for loops

It is common programming practice to use ***i*** and ***j*** for the index values of the outer and inner ***for*** loops, respectively. However, this is often not the most intuitive naming. For this example I will use ***row*** and ***col*** as the index values:

``` r
for(«row» in 1:length(temps))     # cycle thru temps for each row
{
  for(«col» in 1:length(speeds))  # cycle thru speeds for each column
  {
    windChillTable[row,col] = 35.74 +
                              0.6215*temps[row] -
                              35.75*(speeds[col]^0.16) +
                              0.4275*temps[row]*(speeds[col]^0.16);
  }
}
```

### Populating the matrix

The ***windChillTable*** ***for*** loop operates almost exactly the same as the multiplication table. It has a outer loop the cycles through one set of values (temperatures) and send each temperature into the inner loop where it cycles through the second set of values (wind speeds). The main difference is the formula, [supplied by the National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/media/epz/wxcalc/windChill.pdf), is more complicated.

 

But, like the multiplication matrix, each cell in the wind chill matrix...

``` r
windChillMatrix[row,col]
```

is set to a formula that contains the current temperature:

``` r
    windChillTable[row,col] = 35.74 +
                              0.6215*«temps[row]» -
                              35.75*(speeds[col]^0.16) +
                              0.4275*«temps[row]»*(speeds[col]^0.16);
```

and the current wind speed:

``` r
    windChillTable[row,col] = 35.74 +
                              0.6215*temps[row] -
                              35.75*(«speeds[col]»^0.16) +
                              0.4275*temps[row]*(«speeds[col]»^0.16);
```

## Application

1\) For this application, all functions, code, and answers to questions will go in one script named ***1-15.r.*** [Make sure you test all code thoroughly in your script.]{.hl}

 

2\) In comments answer:

a.  What is the disadvantage of putting a function in the same script that it is called from?

b.  How many times does the inner ***for*** loop get executed in ***windChillTable()*** in @sec-example_windchill?

c.  If you reverse the order of the ***for*** loop in the multiplication matrix in @sec-mult-matrix (i.e., outer loop cycles through ***mult2***, inner loop cycles through ***mult1***), what is the order of the calculations?

 

3\) Reverse the order of the ***for*** loops in the wind chill matrix so that the rows are wind speeds and columns and temperatures.

 

4\) Using nested ***for*** loops, create a heat index matrix

-   The formula for heat index is on [page 2 of this document](https://www.weather.gov/media/ffc/ta_htindx.PDF)
-   The formula is only meaningful for temperatures from 70-100 (F) and humidity from 40-80 (percent)
-   You can round the numbers to two significant digits
-   5.12x10^-7^ can be coded as 5.12e-7

 

5\) Create a wind chill matrix function that has temperature and wind speed as arguments and the return value is the wind chill matrix.

 \
So, this code:

``` r
windChill = windchill(temps = seq(from=40, to=-20, by=-10), 
                      speeds = seq(from=5, to=45, by=10))
```

should save to `windChill` a matrix that looks like this @fig-windChillTable

 

6\) Challenge: Create a function that takes a vector of numbers as an argument and returns every pair where one number evenly divides another number.

-   So, if you have the vector `c(3,4,7,12,14,15)`

    -   you have four pairs: (1) **3** divides **12**, (2) **4** divides **12**, (3) **7** divides **14**, (4) **3** divides **15**
    -   Do not include pairs with the same number (e.g., **3** divides **3**, **14** divides **14**)

-   the answer should a ***named vector*** and look like this – the order of the pairs does not matter:

``` {.r tab="Console"}
> evenlyDivides( c(3,4,7,12,14,15) )
 3   4  7  3
12  12 14 15
```

-   A good middle step is to print something to the Console every time you get a pair where one divides the other.
-   Info about naming individual values: [Extension: Create and modify Named vectors]

{{< include ../assets/_AppInstructions.qmd >}}

## Extension: Create and modify Named vectors {.extension}

You can manually create a named vector in the ***Console***:

``` {.r tab="Console"}
> myVec = c(1,2,3,4) 
> names(myVec) = c("z", "y", "x", "w") 
> myVec 
z y x w  
1 2 3 4 
```

***names()*** can also be used to modify the names of individual values in a vector:

``` {.r tab="Console"}
> names(myVec)[2] = "q" 
> myVec
z «q» x w 
1 2 3 4 
```
