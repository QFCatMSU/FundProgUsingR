### To-do

## Purpose

-   stacking dataframe

-   creating line plots and box plots

-   mapping values other than x and y

-   creating a List object

## Script and data for this lesson

The [script for the lesson is here](../scripts/2-09_StackingAndMapping_new.R)

Data for the lesson: [LansingJanTempsFixed.csv](../data/LansingJanTempsFixed.csv)

## GGPlot mapping

This lesson is designed to give an overview of the many issues that occur when you are creating plots in GGPlot and some of the fixes. There is the huge topic of mapping in GGPlot that we use in this lesson, but do not have time to fully explain (we go into much more detail in our dedicated GGPlot class...).  Mapping is how you relate data in a data frame to a visual aspect of a plot.  We have already mapped data in a data frame to the x and y axis of a plot -- but, you can map many other visual aspects to data like size, shape, and, in this lesson, color. 

## Reading in the data frame

We will be using the data from ***lansingJanTempsFixed.csv*** that has 6 years of January temperatures in Fahrenheit.  First we need to read in the file, ***lansJanTempsFixed.csv***, and save the temperature data to a data frame:

``` r
lansJanTempsDF = read.csv(file = "data/lansingJanTempsFixed.csv");
```

## Line Plots

We are going to go over the multiple ways in GGPlot to make a line plot for each of the 6 temperature column in one canvas area.  The ggplot component that creates a line plot is ***geom_line()***.

 

The simplest way to do it is to create six ***geom_line()*** components -- one for each column in the data frame:

``` r
plot1 = ggplot( data=(lansJanTempsDF), 
                «mapping = aes(x=1:31)») + 
  geom_line( mapping=aes(y=Jan2011),
             color = "red") +
  geom_line( mapping=aes(y=Jan2012),
             color = "green") +
  geom_line( mapping=aes(y=Jan2013),
             color = "orange") +
  geom_line( mapping=aes(y=Jan2014),
             color = "blue") +
  geom_line( mapping=aes(y=Jan2015),
             color = "purple") +
  geom_line( mapping=aes(y=Jan2016),
             color = "black") +
  labs( title="January Temperature",
        subtitle="Lansing, MI -- 2011-2016",
        x = "January Days",
        y = "temperature (F)") +
  theme_bw();
plot(plot1);
```

Since the x-axis gets mapped to the same date values (1 to 31) for each line plot, we can place the ***x*** mapping in ***ggplot()*** call.  This makes the ***x*** mapping of **1:31** universal for all components in the canvas area.

 

Each ***geom_line*** component is also customized with a ***color*** subcomponent.

![A line plot for the six temperature columns](images/R-2-09-LinePlot.png){#fig-line_plot .fs}

## Adding a legend

The problem with @fig-line_plot is that the individual line plots are not labelled. We would like to add a legend to the plot that maps the color to the year and adding a legend in GGPlot is awkward.  Generally speaking [GGPlot will put a legend on the plot when something is **mapped** other than **x** or **y**]{.hl}.  We are going to ***map*** color.  To do this, we move ***color*** from being a subcomponent of the ***geom_line*** to being a mapped element of the ***geom_line***.

``` r
plot2 = ggplot( data=(lansJanTempsDF), 
                mapping = aes(x=1:31)) +  
  geom_line( mapping=aes(y=Jan2011, color = "Jan2011") ) +
  geom_line( mapping=aes(y=Jan2012, color = "Jan2012") ) +
  geom_line( mapping=aes(y=Jan2013, color = "Jan2013") ) +
  geom_line( mapping=aes(y=Jan2014, color = "Jan2014") ) +
  geom_line( mapping=aes(y=Jan2015, color = "Jan2015") ) +
  geom_line( mapping=aes(y=Jan2016, color = "Jan2016") ) +
  labs( title="January Temperature",
        subtitle="Lansing, MI -- 2011-2016",
        x = "January Days",
        y = "temperature (F)") +
  theme_bw();
plot(plot2);
```

In this plot, we moved ***color*** to the mapping of the ***geom_line*** and set ***color*** to the text we want displayed in the legend.  This solution adds a legend with the text but the line colors are chosen by GGPlot.  [Note: There is a way to customize these color but that is beyond the scope of this class.]{.note}

![Line plots with a legend -- note that the legend text matches the color mappings](images/R-2-09-Legend.png){#fig-legend .fs}

## Stacking the data frame

The most common (and pretty ugly) technique used to plot multiple line plots on one canvas is to create a new data frame that has all the data you want to plot in two columns -- this process is often called [melting]{.hl} or [stacking]{.hl} the data frame.

 

We can use ***stack()*** to create a stacked data frame:

``` r
stackedDF = stack(lansJanTempsDF);
```

The stacked data frame has the same data as the original data frame but everything is put in two columns:

![A stacked dataframe of the six years of temperature data put into two columns](images/2-09-Stacking.jpg){#fig-two_col_stacked .fs}

The stacked data frame has **186** rows (**31** days \* **6** years) and two columns:

-   ***column 1:*** combined the 6 temperature columns into one column called ***values***

-   ***column 2***: contains the names of the six temperature columns (2011 to 2016) called ***ind***

     

[The 6 years of data are now stacked on top of each-other]{.hl} with the first **31** rows containing values from **2011**, the next **31** rows containing values from **2012**, etc...  The ***ind*** columns give the year the temperatures came from.

### A note from the author about stacked data frame

This author considers stacking data frames to be a bad programming practice but this practice is widely reinforced by R.  The reason stacking a data frame is bad is you are restructuring the data frame to meet the needs of a function.  But, the data frame is an object that should remain fixed.  The better practice is to code functions that match the structure of the data frame.  This is not a difficult task, but, unfortunately, this is not how R operates and there is no good way to get around stacking data frames.

### Plotting the stacked data frame

With the stacked data frame, we only need one ***geom_line*** component to plot all 6 lines.  This works because of the ***color*** mapping.  The ***color*** mapping tells GGPlot to create a distinct line for each different value in the ***ind*** column -- and set each to a different color.  The ***ind*** column has 6 different value -- the 6 column names from the original data frame (***Jan2011***, ***Jan2012***,...).

 

The x-axis represents the days from 1 to 31.  We have 186 rows but every 31 rows represents a new line plot (31 \* 6 = 186).  So, we want to repeat the values 1 to 31 six times.

 

The ***y*** mapping is the temperature values from the original data frame put into one long ***values*** column.

``` r
plot3 = ggplot( data=(stackedDF)) +  
  geom_line( mapping=«aes(x=rep(1:31, times=6)», y=values, color=ind) ) +
  labs( title="January Temperature",
        subtitle="Lansing, MI -- 2011-2016",
        x = "January Days",
        y = "temperature (F)") +
  theme_bw();
plot(plot3);
```

![Plotting using a stacked dataframe](images/R-2-09-StackedLines.png){#fig-plot_stacked .fs}

## Using for loops to plot 6 columns

I consider using for loops to be the most robust solution because it gives you more control over what to plot and it maintains the integrity of the original data frame.  It is also probably the most difficult method:

``` r
  plot4 = ggplot( data=(lansJanTempsDF));  # create a canvas
  for(i in 1:ncol(lansJanTempsDF))         # add plots to canvas one at a time
  {
    # replace i by with !!(i) -- avoids Lazy Evaluation
    «plot4 = plot4» + geom_line( mapping=aes(x=1:nrow(lansJanTempsDF), 
                                             y=lansJanTempsDF[,«!!(i)»], 
                                             color=colnames(lansJanTempsDF)[«!!(i)»]) )
  }
  # add the labels and theme to the canvas
  «plot4 = plot4» + labs( title="January Temperature",
          subtitle="Lansing, MI -- 2011-2016",
          x = "January Days",
          y = "temperature (F)") +
  theme_bw();
  plot(plot4);
```

In this example, the ***for*** loop adds the six plot components to the ***plot4*** canvas one at a time.  When mapping in a ***for*** loop, you need to replace the index variable, in this case ***i***, with ***!!(i)***.  The reason is here: [Extension: Lazy Evaluation]

 

After the plot components are added, we then add the labels and theme to ***plot4***.

![Using for loops to plot 6 column -- this authors believes this is the most robust solution](images/R-2-09-ForLoopPlot.png){#fig-for_stacked .fs}

## Unstacking the data frame

You can take a stacked data frame and return it to original state using ***unstack()***:

``` r
origDF = unstack(stackedDF);
```

And ***origDF*** looks just like the original ***lansJanTempDF***

![Unstacking a dataframe return you to the original dataframe](images/2-09-Unstacking.jpg){#fig-unstacking .fs}

 

[Note: The stacked version of a dataframe is often called **long format** and the original dataframe called **wide format.**]{.note}

## Boxplots

A good way to visually compare the six years of January temperatures is to use a boxplot.  In GGPlot, the component to use is ***geom_boxplot.***   For our first attempt, we will just create two boxes representing the columns ***Jan2011*** and ***Jan2012***.

 

Like all plotting components in GGPlot, ***geom_boxplot*** needs to be mapped.  The y-axis represents the temperatures so we can map ***y*** to the columns, ***Jan2011*** in one box and ***Jan2012*** in the other.

 

We also need to map ***x*** to something otherwise the two boxplots will appear right on top of each other (try it!). We can start by mapping the boxplot to the years they represent:

``` r
plot5 = ggplot(data=lansJanTempsDF) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping=aes(x=2011, y=Jan2011)) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping=aes(x=2012, y=Jan2012)) +
  theme_bw();
plot(plot5);  
```

This code successfully creates two boxplots but the x-axis is a bit weird:

![The boxes for January temperatures in 2011 and 2012](images/2-09-Boxplot-Num-X.png){#fig-boxplot1 .fs}

 

Because we used numbers to map the x-axis, GGPlot assumed a continuous and numeric x-axis.  But, the [x-axis in a boxplot is really a discrete axis]{.hl} -- we are not plotting value in between 2011 and 2012.  If we want a discrete axis, then we need to put the years in quotes (i.e., make the year a string value):

``` r
  plot6 = ggplot(data=lansJanTempsDF) +
    geom_boxplot(mapping=aes(«x="2011"», y=Jan2011)) +
    geom_boxplot(mapping=aes(«x="2012"», y=Jan2012)) +
    theme_bw();
  plot(plot6);
```

Now, we have a discrete x-axis:

![The same boxplots with a discrete x-axis](images/2-09-Boxplot-String-X.png){#fig-boxplot_discrete .fs}

## Box Plots using the stacked dataframe

Just like with lines plots, there is no great way to create boxes from multiple columns in a dataframe.  We could plot all six columns by creating six ***geom_boxplot*** components, one for each year.  But, in programming, you generally do not want to repeat code -- this would get messy if there were 20 columns.

 

The most common technique used for plotting multiple columns is to use a stacked dataframe.

 

Using the stacked dataframe, we can plot all 6 years using one ***geom_boxplot*** component.  The works by mapping ***x*** to the ***ind*** column (which has the years) and mapping ***y*** to the ***values*** column (which has all the temperature values).

``` r
plot7 = ggplot(data=stackedDF) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping=aes(x=ind, y=values)) +
  theme_bw();
plot(plot7);
```

The x-axis of the boxplot is labelled with the names of the columns and the y-axis has the box for each year:

![Boxes for all six columns using the stacked data frame](images/R-2-09-All-Boxes.png){#fig-six_boxes_stacked .fs}

## Stacking a subset of the columns

We might not want all of the data from the original dataframe. We can create a stacked dataframe that only has a subset of the columns from the original data frame.

 

This stacked dataframe only has the values from **2** columns, the3^rd^ and 6^th^ (2013 and 2016-- **62** values in all):

``` r
stackedDF2 = stack(lansJanTempsDF[,c(3,6)]); # 2013 and 2016
```

And this stacked dataframe has the values from **4** columns: the1^st^, 2^nd^, 5^th^, and 6^th^ (2011, 2012, 2015, & 2016 -- **124** values in all):

``` r
stackedDF3 = stack(lansJanTempsDF[,c(1,2,5,6)]); # 2011, 2012, 2015, & 2016
```

In the ***Environment*** tab we see the two new stacked dataframes, both with 2 columns (***values*** and ***ind***) and 62 values (for two Januaries) and 124 values (for four Januaries)

``` {.r tab="Environment"}
🞃 stackedDF2:   62 obs. of 2 variables
    $ values: num 25 26 29 33 35 35 ...
    $ ind    :  Factor w/ 2 levels "Jan2013",...
🞃 stackedDF3:   124 obs. of 4 variables
    $ values: num 54 25 33 32 23 ...
    $ ind    :  Factor w/ 4 levels "Jan2011",...
```

### Plotting the subset stacked dataframe

We can plot the four boxes from dataframe ***stackedDF3*** just like we plotting all six boxes using ***stackedDF***:

``` r
plot8 = ggplot(data=«stackedDF3») +
  geom_boxplot(mapping=aes(x=ind, y=values)) +
  theme_bw();
plot(plot8);
```

![Plotting boxes from a stacked dataframe that has been subsetted](images/R-2-09-StackedSubsetBox.png){#fig_box_subset_stacked .fs}

### Plotting a subset using for loops

Again, this author believes the most robust way to plot the subset data is to use ***for*** loop.  Once again, this allows you to work with the original data frame -- there is no need to create a stacked data frame.

``` r
plot9 = ggplot( data=(lansJanTempsDF)); 
for(i in «c(1,2,5,6)»)   # cycle through the four columns
{
  ## map the column names to x and the column values to y
  plot9 = plot9 + geom_boxplot(mapping=aes(x=colnames(lansJanTempsDF)[!!(i)], 
                                            y=lansJanTempsDF[,!!(i)] ))
}
plot9 = plot9 + theme_bw();
plot(plot9);
```

In this code,

-   the ***for*** loops only cycles through the four columns we want to plot ***c(1,2,5,6)***. 

-   ***x*** is mapped to the subsetted column name

-   ***y*** is mapped to the subsetted column values

## Saving data frames to one object

In this lesson, we created four data frames:

-   ***lansJanTempsDF***: the original data frame

-   ***stackedDF***: a stacked version of the full data frame

-   ***stackedDF2***: a stacked version of columns 3 and 6 only

-   ***stackedDF3***: a stacked version of columns 1, 3, 5, and 6

     

We are going to use these data frames in the next lesson.  In the next lesson, we could just reopen the ***lansingJanTempsFixed.csv*** file, save the data to a data frame and then create the stacked dataframes.  But, since we have already done that work, it would be easier to pass the data frames from this lesson to the next lesson.

 

We will create one object that holds all four data frame using ***list()***.  The object is a ***List*** object (we will be talking a lot more about List object in the next few lessons):

``` r
temperatureDFs= list("origDF" = lansJanTempsDF,
                     "stackedDF" = stackedDF,
                     "stackDF_3_6" = stackedDF2,
                     "stackedDF_1_2_5_6" = stackedDF3);
```

The value in quotes is the name of the object -- you can choose the name but you should use variable naming conventions.

 

***temperatureDFs*** appear in the ***Environment*** as a ***List*** object with four data frames inside it.  We can view the data frames in the list by clicking on the arrow in the ***Environment*** tab or double-clicking on ***temperatureDFs*** to see it in a viewer tab:

![The List object in the Environment and the viewer tab](images/R-2-09-ListObject.jpg){#fig-list_object .fs}

### Saving the List object to a file

We want to use the ***List*** object with four data frames in the next lesson.  To do this, [we need to save the **List** to a file]{.hl} -- a file we will open in the next lesson:

``` r
save(temperatureDFs, file = "data/tempDFs.rdata");
```

There should now be a file named ***tempDFs.rdata*** in the ***data*** folder of your Project that contains ***temperatureDFs***.

## Application

A\) [Open the file Lansing2016NOAA.csv](../data/Lansing2016NOAA.csv) and save the contents of the file to a data frame named ***weatherData***

 

B\) Create a stacked data frame named ***stackedWD*** that only contains the three temperature columns from ***weatherData*** (***maxTemp***, ***avgTemp***, and ***minTemp***). 

-   ***stackedWD*** will have 2 columns (***values*** and ***ind***) and 1098 rows (366 \* 3).

     

C\) Create six GGPlot canvases, the individual canvases will contain:

1.  Three lines plots (***maxTemp***, ***avgTemp***, and ***minTemp***) using ***weatherData*** and three ***geom_line*** components -- the method used in @fig-line_plot

2.  Three lines plots (***maxTemp***, ***avgTemp***, and ***minTemp***) using ***stackedWD*** and one ***geom_line*** component.

3.  Three lines plots (***maxTemp***, ***avgTemp***, and ***minTemp***) using ***weatherData*** and a ***for*** loop.

4.  Three box plots (***maxTemp***, ***avgTemp***, and ***minTemp***) using ***weatherData*** and three ***geom_boxplot*** components

5.  Three box plots (***maxTemp***, ***avgTemp***, and ***minTemp***) using ***stackedWD*** and one ***geom_boxplot*** component.

6.  Three box plots (***maxTemp***, ***avgTemp***, and ***minTemp***) using ***weatherData*** and a ***for*** loop.

## Extension: Lazy Evaluation

This is probably the one programming topic that has caused the most agony in this author's life as it is unintuitive and happens unexpectedly in many programming languages...

 

There are **7** columns in ***lansJanTempsDF***, which means the ***for*** loop will cycle **7** times. Each time with a different value for ***i*** (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7).

``` r
for(i in 1:ncol(lansJanTempsDF))         # add plots to canvas one at a time
{
  plot4 = plot4 + geom_line( mapping=aes(x=1:nrow(lansJanTempsDF), 
                                         y=lansJanTempsDF[,i], 
                                         color=colnames(lansJanTempsDF)[i]) )
}
```

However, if you execute the code above you will only see one plot – the plot for the seventh cycle (when ***i=7***). Actually, [the seventh plot got plotted seven times]{.hl} but they overlap each other so you only see one.

 

The reason this happens is that R, in the background, will first stack up the code from all seven cycles of the ***for*** loop like this:

``` r
plot4 = plot4 + geom_line( mapping=aes(x=1:nrow(lansJanTempsDF), 
                                         y=lansJanTempsDF[,«i»], 
                                         color=colnames(lansJanTempsDF)[«i»])
plot4 = plot4 + geom_line( mapping=aes(x=1:nrow(lansJanTempsDF), 
                                         y=lansJanTempsDF[,«i»], 
                                         color=colnames(lansJanTempsDF)[«i»])
plot4 = plot4 + geom_line( mapping=aes(x=1:nrow(lansJanTempsDF), 
                                         y=lansJanTempsDF[,«i»], 
                                         color=colnames(lansJanTempsDF)[«i»])
... (4 more) ...
```

And then execute each command in the stack. This happens all the time when programming ***for*** loops and it is normally not an issue. Except, in this case, R does not realize that ***i*** is the index variable. R assumes that ***i=7*** because that is the value of ***i*** at the end of the ***for*** loop (i.e., after the seventh cycle). So, R replaces ***i*** with 7 for every command. This is called [Lazy Evaluation]{.hl} and I cannot explain why it happens here, but I can say that I have experienced it many times in many programming languages in my career.

 

***!!()*** is a function that forces R to immediately evaluate what is inside the parentheses (i.e., before R stacks the commands). This means the stacked commands will look like this and execute properly:

``` r
plot4 = plot4 + geom_line( mapping=aes(x=1:nrow(lansJanTempsDF), 
                                         y=lansJanTempsDF[,«1»], 
                                         color=colnames(lansJanTempsDF)[«1»])
plot4 = plot4 + geom_line( mapping=aes(x=1:nrow(lansJanTempsDF), 
                                         y=lansJanTempsDF[,«2»], 
                                         color=colnames(lansJanTempsDF)[«2»])
plot4 = plot4 + geom_line( mapping=aes(x=1:nrow(lansJanTempsDF), 
                                         y=lansJanTempsDF[,«3»], 
                                         color=colnames(lansJanTempsDF)[«3»])
... (4 more) ...
```
