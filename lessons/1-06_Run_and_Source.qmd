### Changes...

## Purpose

-   look at some of the features of R and RStudio

-   explore the differences between ***Run*** and ***Source***

### Files for the lesson

The [script for the lesson is here](../scripts/1-06_RunAndSource.R)

The [data for this lesson is here](../data/twoWeekWeatherData.csv)

 

In this lesson the focus is on features in R and RStudio.  In the next lesson the focus will be more on the content of the lesson's script.

 

If you have any questions about the material in this lesson, feel free to email them to the instructor, {{< var instructor.name >}}, at {{< var instructor.email >}}.

## Output to console

In the next couple of lesson we are going to make extensive use of the ***Console*** tab, which can be used to execute code and as output for your script file.  Like the ***Environment*** tab, it is difficult to maintain images so I will use text instead.

 

For example:

-   open the script for this lesson in your RStudio Project

-   click on line **4** (i.e., put the cursor on line 4)

-   click ***Run***

 

The RStudio window looks like this:

![Output to the Console tab after executing line 6](images/R-1-06-OutputToConsole.png){#fig-console-output .fs}

 

Instead of displaying the RStudio image, I will display the output to the ***Console*** tab like this:

::: {#fig-consoleTab}
``` {.r tab="Console"}
«>»   ### Output a text message
«>»   cat("Hello"); 
Hello
```

Output to the Console tab after executing line 4
:::

## Run vs. Source

The ***Source*** button is used to execute the whole script (i.e., every command in the script) while the ***Run*** button is used to selectively execute commands.  ***Run*** is a great tool for debugging and testing your code. We are going to almost exclusively use ***Run*** for the next two lessons.

 

The next two lessons are more about showing off features in R and RStudio and not about creating a full script.  However, your goal with most scripts is to be able to execute the file using ***Source***.  It takes longer to develop you script using ***Source*** but it forces you to automate your script which makes your script both easier to debug and share.

### Executing one line

We already have an example of using ***Run*** to execute one line in @fig-consoleTab.  When we put the cursor on line **4** and clicked ***Run***, R executed the ***cat()*** command on line **4**.  We will talk much more about ***cat()*** next lesson but ***cat()*** outputs to the ***Console*** whatever is in the parentheses.

 

Actually, clicking ***Run*** does not just execute the line, but everything associate with the command on the line.  When you look at the ***Console*** output, you see that lines **3** and **4** were both executed -- but line 3 was just a comment line so it does not do anything.

::: {#fig-commandLines}
``` {.r tab="Console"}
>   ### Output a text message  
>   cat("Hello");             
Hello                          
```

Lines in Console that start with a ( **\>** ) are command lines
:::

### Executing multiple commands on one line

You can put as many command as you want on one line as long as use semicolons between them.

 

The following line has three commands that

-   create two variables (***a*** and ***b***)

-   output the addition of them to the ***Console***. 

``` {.r tab="Environment"}
a=3; b=7; cat("a+b=", a+b);
```

Clicking ***Run*** on the line will add ***a*** and ***b*** to the ***Environment***:

``` {.r tab="Environment"}
a:   3
b:   7
```

And the addition of ***a*** and ***b*** is displayed in the ***Console***:

``` {.r tab="Console"}
>   ### Multiple commands on one line
>   a=3; b=7; cat("a+b=", a+b);
a+b= 10
```

If you remove the semicolons then you will get the error: [unexpected symbol in "  a=3 b"]{.hl}

R is saying the it does not understand what the symbol ***b*** means because R thinks that ***b*** is a continuation of the ***a=3*** command.

### Executing highlighted script

You can also highlight parts of your script and ***Run*** will executed exactly what is highlighted.

 

If you completely highlight lines 10, 11, and 12:

``` r
  cat("Hello, World.\n");
  cat("How are you?\n");
  cat("I am fine?\n");
```

and click ***Run***, the output to the ***Console*** is:

::: {#fig-threeCommands}
``` {.r tab="Console"}
>   cat("Hello, World.\n");
Hello, World.
>   cat("How are you?\n");
How are you?
>   cat("I am fine?\n");
I am fine?
```

Three commands sent to Console by clicking Run
:::

When you highlight code and click ***Run***, [**Run** will execute exactly what you highlight]{.hl}.  So, if you accidentally highlight a bit of line 9 along with lines 10-12:

``` r
  ### Outputting multiple text messages «(\n means go to next line)»
  «cat("Hello, World.\n");»
  «cat("How are you?\n");»
  «cat("I am fine?\n");»
```

Then in the ***Console*** you will get the error:

``` {.r tab="Console"}
> (\n means go to next line)
Error: unexpected symbol in "(\n"
```

R is trying to execute the last part of line 9 and R does not know that this is supposed to be part of a comment because you did not highlight the **\###** part of the line.

 

To recap, when you click ***Run*** and...:

-   ...the cursor is in a line: R will execute all commands on that line.

-   ...part of your code is highlighted: R will execute exactly what is highlighted

### Executing one command on multiple lines

Lines 15-17 contain the command to open the ***twoWeekWeatherData.csv*** file and save the data to a data frame named ***weatherData***.

``` r
  ### read in data from  twoWeekWeatherData.csv
  weatherData = read.csv(file="data/twoWeekWeatherData.csv", 
                         sep=",",
                         header=TRUE);
```

When you click ***Run***, R will execute whatever command the cursor is in the middle of. If we put the cursor on any line from 15-17 and click ***Run***, [R will execute all 3 lines]{.hl}. In this case, the command starts on line 15 with ***weatherData =*** and ends on line 17 with ***header=TRUE);***.

 

When we ***Run*** line **15**, the ***Console*** output shows lines 14-17 (14 is a comment) were executed -- the ( **+** ) at the beginning of the lines in the ***Console*** says that this line is a continuation of the command from the previous line.

::: {#fig-multiline}
``` {.r tab="Console"}
>   ### read in data from  twoWeekWeatherData.csv
>   weatherData = read.csv(file="data/twoWeekWeatherData.csv", 
«+»                          sep=",",
«+»                          header=TRUE);
```

Console output when executing the multi-line command to open the csv file
:::

Executing lines 14-17 means that you have a new variable named ***weatherData*** and this variable is put in the ***Environment*** tab:

::: {#fig-readcsv}
``` {.r tab="Environment"}
weatherData   14 obs. of 5 variables
```

The Environment tab after the read.csv() command was executed
:::

## Entering commands directly into Console

When you click ***Run*** you are sending commands to the ***Console***, but you can directly type commands in the ***Console*** -- and it will produce the same results.

 

So, if you type ***cat("Hello")*** into the ***Console*** you will get:

``` {.r tab="Console"}
> cat("Hello")
Hello
```

A common issue for people using the ***Console*** is that they will not complete commands.  For example, type **cat("He** in the ***Console*** and press ***enter***:

``` {.r tab="Console"}
> cat("He
+
```

A ( **+** ) appears on the next line.  The ( **+** ) means that R sees the beginning of an unfinished command and is waiting for you to finish it. [This will also happen if you highlight only part of a command in the script and press **Run**]{.hl}.  You can finish it by typing ***llo")*** in the ***Console*** but the results will still be a bit off:

``` {.r tab="Console"}
> cat("He
+llo")
He
llo
```

If you see a ( ***+*** ) in the ***Console*** and have no idea what to do, [you can press the **esc** key to get out of it.]{.hl}

### Quick view of variables

Another use for the ***Console*** is to quickly view some value.  If you want to see the ***highTemp*** column in ***weatherData*** you can type in the ***Console***:

``` {.r tab="Console"}
> weatherData$highTemp
 [1] 57 50 54 40 39 58 60 53 55 44 39 54 61 75
```

[Note: after you type **\$** in **weatherData\$**, RStudio will start offering you column suggestions – a very convenient feature when you have large dataframes.]{.note}

## Duplicating lines of code

Quite often in programming, you are producing multiple lines that are very similar.  For instance, you might have multiple lines that start with a ***cat()*** command.  In RStudio you can duplicate a line by putting your cursor on the line and clicking ***Control-Shift-D*** (Windows) or ***Command-Shift-D*** (Mac).

 

If you click ***Control/Command-Shift-D*** on line ***12***, you will get:

::: {#fig-duplication}
``` r
  ### Outputting multiple text messages
  cat("Hello, World.");
  cat("How are you?");
  cat("I am fine?"); 
  «cat("I am fine?");»
```

Duplicating a line in RStudio using Control/Command-Shift-D
:::

If you [highlight text within your script]{.hl} and click ***Control/Command-Shift-D***, then the highlighted text will be duplicated.  In this case, I highlighted the first ***Hello, World.*** and then clicked ***Control/Command-Shift-D***:

::: {#fig-duplicateText}
``` r
  ### Outputting multiple text messages
  cat("Hello, World.«Hello, World.»");
  cat("How are you?");
  cat("I am fine?"); 
```

Duplicating highlighted text in RStudio.
:::

## Block Comments

Often when you are testing code you want to comment lines so they do not execute.  In RStudio you can comment a bunch of lines at once by highlighting the lines you want commented and clicking ***Control-Shift-C*** on Windows and ***Command-Shift-C*** on a Mac.

 

If you highlight lines 11-14 and press ***Control/Command-Shift-C***, a ( [\#]{.hl}) will appear at the beginning of each line:

::: {#fig-commentLines}
``` r
«#» ### Outputting multiple text messages
«#» cat("Hello, World");
«#» cat("How are you?");
«#» cat("I am fine?");
```

Commenting multiple line by using Control/Command-Shift-C
:::

[Note: A ( **\#** ) is added to all highlighted lines -- even those that were already commented like line 11]{.note}

### Uncommenting a block

If all the lines highlighted already have a ( **\#** ) then pressing ***Control/Command-Shift-C*** will uncomment all the lines (i.e., remove a #).  Uncommenting only removed the first **\#** -- so if you uncomment the lines from @fig-commentLines, then the lines will revert back to:

::: {#fig-uncommentLines}
``` r
### Outputting multiple text messages
cat("Hello, World");
cat("How are you?");
cat("I am fine?");
```

Uncommenting lines -- only 1 \# is removed so the first line is still commented
:::

## Keyboard shortcuts in RStudio

***Control/Command-Shift-C*** and ***Control/Command-Shift-D*** are the RStudio shortcuts I find the most useful. You can view all the keyboard shortcuts (and there are a lot) in RStudio by clicking ***Tools -\> Keyboard Shortcuts Help***.

## Breaking up long lines of code

Line 15-17 is one command stretched over multiple lines:

Just like a period ends a sentence, [a semicolon designates the end of a statement]{.hl}.  In this case, the ***read.csv()*** statement is three lines long so the semicolon goes at the end of the third line.  As a reminder, [R does not enforce semicolon usage]{.note}, but it is a good idea to put them in.

 

We could put the whole command on one line and it would execute exactly the same:

``` r
  ### same command as above -- this is a little harder to read
  weatherData2 = read.csv(file="data/twoWeekWeatherData.csv", sep=",", header=TRUE); 
```

***weatherData2*** appears in the ***Environment*** alongside ***weatherData***, and it is exactly the same as ***weatherData***:

``` {.r tab="Environment"}
weatherData     14 obs. of 5 variables
weatherData2    14 obs. of 5 variables
```

But, it is easier to read the multiple-line code.  As a general rule, [you should try to avoid horizontal scrolling of your script]{.hl} (anything beyond 85 characters) as this makes the script much harder to read.

 

In R, you can break most lines of code into multiple lines with a few exceptions (one exception being long file-paths). You just need to be judicious about how you break up the line -- the best places to break up a line of code are after a comma or where a space occurs.

## Putting margin lines in your script

The generally accepted standard in R for the maximum number of characters in a line of code is 80.  This is not a hard-and-fast rule, but keeping your lines 85 characters or less makes it a lot easier to read your code especially on smaller monitors (e.g., laptops).  You can put a margin line at 85 characters in RStudio by clicking ***Tools -\> Global Options -\> Code.*** On the ***Display*** tab check ***Show margin*** and set ***Margin column*** to **85.** [One of the requirements of this class is that, when possible, you keep your script lines to 85 characters or less.]{.hl}

![setting a reminder line margin in RStudio](images/R-1-06-MarginColumn.png){#fig-line-margin .fs}

Now you will see a grey vertical line at 85 characters (@fig-lineMargin) . The line is there as a guide -- you can still type beyond this line. There are times when it is not possible to keep a line to 85 characters -- the most common reason is a long file-path name because file-path names cannot be broken up.

![The grey line acts as a margin guide.](images/R-1-06-LineMargin.png){#fig-lineMargin .fs}

[Note: You can also see the cursor's character position is on in the lower-left corner of @fig-lineMargin -- in this case, line 9, character 85.]{.note}

## Application

1.  Highlight lines 15 and 16 in the lesson script and click ***Run***.  In comments explain what happens and why.

2.  Highlight lines 16 and 17 in the lesson script and click ***Run***.  In comments explain what happens and why.

3.  Combine the lines 10, 11, and 12 into one line -- don't change the ***cat()*** commands.

4.  In comments answer the following questions:

    -   How many commands are there in the script file for this lesson?

    -   Assuming there is no limit for line length (i.e., you can go as far beyond 85 characters as you want): If you rewrote the script, what is the minimum number of lines you would need to execute every command?
