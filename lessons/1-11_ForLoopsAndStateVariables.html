<h2>For loops -- a vital skill</h2>
<p>In this lesson, we will be using <em><strong>for</strong> </em>loops and <em><strong>if()</strong></em> statements to do common calculations on a vector (e.g., finding the sum, finding maximum value, checking if any value meets a condition).&nbsp; There are functions for all of these calculations in R that are easier to use than a for loop.&nbsp; But, the best way to learn <em><strong>for</strong> </em>loops is to use them in applications that are easy to understand.&nbsp; You are going to have many situations where you cannot rely on an R function or package -- and <em><strong>for</strong> </em>loops with embedded <em><strong>if-else</strong></em> statements are the best solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Understanding how to effectively use <em><strong>for</strong> </em>loops is perhaps the most vital skill you will learn as a programmer.</p>
<h2>Multiple state variables</h2>
<p>We ended last lesson by introducing you to the concept of a<em class="hl"> state variable</em> -- this is a variable that updates information (e.g., the state of some value) as the <em><strong>for</strong> </em>loops cycles.&nbsp; The state variable is always declared outside of the <em><strong>for </strong></em>loop and modified within the <em><strong>for </strong></em>loop.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="note">Note: if the state variable was declared inside the for loop then it would be re-initialized every time the for loop iterate.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The state variable also needs to be initialized to some default value -- or the value the state variable should be if the <em><strong>for </strong></em>loop has no cycles (an empty vector).&nbsp; In the last example from last lesson, the state variable <em><strong>sunnyDays</strong> </em>was initialized to <strong>0. </strong></p>
<p></p>
<p class="code nn">sunnyDays = 0; # state variable -- will hold the count of sunny days</p>
<p class="code nn"><br>for(i in 1:numDays)<br>{<br>&nbsp; if(noonCond[i] == "Sunny")&nbsp; # was the day sunny<br>&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sunnyDays = sunnyDays +1;&nbsp;&nbsp; # it was -- increase sunnyDays by 1<br>&nbsp; }</p>
<p class="code nn">&nbsp; # there is no else here -- we don't care about non-sunny days<br>}</p>
<p class="fig" id="statevar">Using a state variable to calculate how many sunny days there was in <strong>noonCond </strong>(from last lesson)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, let's expand this <em><strong>for </strong></em>loop to count for two different conditions: Sunny and Rain.&nbsp; We will now need two state variables -- initializing both values to <strong>0</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="code nn">sunnyDays = 0; # state variable -- will hold the count of sunny days</p>
<p class="code nn">rainyDays = 0; # state variable -- will hold the count of rainy days</p>
<p class="code"></p>
<p class="code" id="elseif">for(i in 1:numDays)<br>{<br>&nbsp; if(noonCond[i] == "Sunny")<br>&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sunnyDays = sunnyDays +1; # increases sunnyDays by 1<br>&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; # We use else if here because we know "Sunny" and "Rain" are mutually exclusive<br>&nbsp; else if(noonCond[i] == "Rain")<br>&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rainyDays = rainyDays +1; # increases rainyDays by 1<br>&nbsp; }<br>}</p>
<p class="fig" id="statevars">Using multiple state variables</p>
<p></p>
<p>And we can look in the <em><strong>Environment</strong> </em>tab to see what the final values of <em><strong>rainyDays</strong> and <strong>sunnyDays </strong></em>were:</p>
<p class="code">rainyDays: &nbsp; 3</p>
<p class="code nn" title="Environment">sunnyDays:&nbsp;&nbsp; 6</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can double check the <em><strong>noonCond</strong> </em>vector and see there are 6 sunny and 3 rain days.</p>
<p class="code nn" title="Console">&gt; noonCond<br>[1] "Cloudy" "Cloudy" "Sunny" "Rain" "Fog" "Sunny" "Sunny" "Cloudy" "Rain" "Rain" <br>[11] "Snow" "Sunny" "Sunny" "Sunny"</p>
<h3>The if-else statement</h3>
<p>In <em class="ref" id="r-statevars">fig ##</em> we used an<em><strong> if-else</strong></em> structure to separate the two conditional statement (sunny and rainy).&nbsp; We could have just used two <em><strong>if()</strong></em> statements.&nbsp; In other words, the 8<sup>th</sup> line could have been written:</p>
<p></p>
<p class="code" title="8">if(noonCond[i] == "Rain")</p>
<p></p>
<p>But we would be checking for <strong>Rain </strong>on days that we already know is <strong>Sunny</strong>.&nbsp; <em><strong>noonCond</strong></em> on a specific day cannot be both <strong>Sunny </strong>and <strong>Rain </strong>(i.e., they are mutually exclusive) -- so the extra checks are not needed.&nbsp; The code would still work, just not be as efficient.&nbsp; But, efficiency becomes more important as the number of values in your vector increases -- and efficiency means quicker execution time.</p>
<h2>State variables uses</h2>
<p>We can also use state variables on numeric value to count how many times a condition is met such as the temperature being in a certain range.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this case, we will look at how many time</p>
<ul>
<li>the temperature was greater than 60</li>
<li>the temperature was less than 50.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>We are looking at two situations so we need two state variables.&nbsp; Again, we initialize the values of the state variables to <strong>0</strong> because <strong>0</strong> would be the correct answer if the conditions inside the <em><strong>if-else</strong> </em>statement were <strong>FALSE</strong> for every day.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="code">tempGT60 = 0; # days with temperatures greater than 60<br>tempLT50 = 0; # days with temperatures less than 50<br><br>for(i in 1:numDays)<br>{<br>&nbsp; if(highTemps[i] &gt; 60)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # high temp more than 60<br>&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tempGT60 = tempGT60 +1; <br>&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; else if(highTemps[i] &lt; 50) # high temp less than 50<br>&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tempLT50 = tempLT50 +1;<br>&nbsp; }<br>}</p>
<p class="fig">Using multiple state variables to look at temperature values</p>
<p></p>
<p>And we can look in the <em><strong>Environment</strong> </em>tab to see the final values of the state variables:</p>
<p class="code nn" title="Environment">tempGT60:&nbsp;&nbsp; 2</p>
<p class="code">tempLT50: &nbsp; 4</p>
<p></p>
<p>Again, you can check <em><strong>highTemps</strong> </em>in the <em><strong>Console </strong></em>to see this is correct:</p>
<p class="code nn" title="Console">&gt; highTemps<br>[1] 57 50 54 40 39 58 60 53 55 44 39 54 61 75</p>
<h3>Sequences with the for loops</h3>
<p>Perhaps you do not want to check every day -- maybe you only want to check every-other day.&nbsp; In this case you use <em><strong>seq()</strong></em> in the <em><strong>for</strong> </em>loop to subset the days:</p>
<p class="code">tempGT60odd = 0; # odd indexed days with temperatures greater than 60<br>tempLT50odd = 0; # odd indexed days with temperatures less than 50<br><br>for(i in <em class="hl">seq(from=1, to=numDays, by=2)</em>) # every other day (1,3,5,7...)<br>{<br>&nbsp; if(highTemps[i] &gt; 60)<br>&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tempGT60odd = tempGT60odd +1; <br>&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; else if(highTemps[i] &lt; 50)<br>&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tempLT50odd = tempLT50odd +1;<br>&nbsp; }<br>}</p>
<p></p>
<p>And, again, the <em><strong>Environment</strong> </em>tab will show the final values of the state variables:</p>
<p class="code nn" title="Environment">tempGT60odd:&nbsp;&nbsp; 1</p>
<p class="code">tempLT50odd: &nbsp; 2</p>
<h2>State variable to sum values</h2>
<p>We have used state variables as a counter -- adding 1 to the state variable during each iteration of a <em><strong>for </strong></em>loop when a condition is <em><strong>TRUE</strong></em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this case we want to add up all the precipitation values to get the total precipitation.&nbsp; Again, we initialize the state variable to default value of 0, because 0 is the answer if there are no days to check. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The difference is that, instead of adding 1 to the state variable, <em class="hl">we add the precipitation for that day</em>, or <em><strong>precip[i]</strong></em> where<em><strong> i</strong></em> is the index variable.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="note">Note: there are no <strong>if()</strong> statements in this <strong>for </strong>loop because we are unconditionally adding every days' precipitation to the total precipitation</p>
<p class="code">totalPrecip = 0;<br>for(i in 1:numDays)<br>{<br>&nbsp; totalPrecip = totalPrecip + precip[i];<br>}</p>
<p class="fig">Using a state variable to add values</p>
<h2>if-any checks</h2>
<p>This time, instead of counting the number of days that meet a condition, we are just going to see if <em class="hl">any value in the vector meets a condition</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are going to initialize the state variable to <em><strong>FALSE </strong></em>and if any variable meets the condition, the state variable will be changed to <em><strong>TRUE</strong></em>.&nbsp; The condition we will look is whether a temperature is less than 40.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="ref" id="r-truefalse">Extension: Using T and F for TRUE and FALSE is a bad idea</p>
<p></p>
<p class="code">anyDayLT40 = FALSE;</p>
<p class="code"><br>for(i in 1:numDays)<br>{<br>&nbsp; if(highTemps[i] &lt; 40)<br>&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anyDayLT40 = TRUE;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # break;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # when uncommented, this will break out of the for loop<br>&nbsp; }<br>}</p>
<p class="fig">Using for loops to find out if any value in a vectors meets a condition</p>
<p></p>
<p>After executing the script, we see that <em><strong>anyDayLT40</strong> </em>in <strong>TRUE</strong> in the <em><strong>Environment</strong></em>.&nbsp; You can easily test other scenarios by changing the <em><strong>if()</strong></em> condition.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<p class="code nn">&nbsp; if(highTemps[i] &lt; 30)&nbsp; # this will produce a FALSE result</p>
<h3>The break statement</h3>
<p>This <em><strong>for</strong> </em>loop is inefficient because it will continue to check every temperature value even after one of them passes the condition.&nbsp; This is not necessary because we only care if at least one value meets the condition.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you uncomment the <em><strong>break</strong> </em>line then R will break out of the <em><strong>for </strong></em>loop as soon as the condition <em><strong>highTemps[i] &lt; 40</strong> </em>is <em><strong>TRUE</strong></em>.&nbsp; This does not change the final results but it does speed it up the script bit by not doing unnecessary cycles of the <em><strong>for </strong></em>loop.</p>
<h2>Finding the highest (or lowest) value</h2>
<p>For the last example we are going to find the highest temperature in a vector.&nbsp; We do this by iterating though each value in the vector <em><strong>highTemps </strong></em>and comparing it to the current highest temperature.&nbsp; If the new value is higher than the highest temperature, then we set that to be the highest temperature.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here is the code -- we will go over it in more detail in a bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>highestTemp = 0;&nbsp; # initialize the state variable to 0</p>
<p></p>
<p>for (i in 1:numDays)</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>&nbsp; if(highTemps[i] &gt; highestTemp)&nbsp;# is this day's value grater than the current high</p>
<p>&nbsp; {</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # this day's value is higher -- set highestTemp to this value</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; highestTemp = highTemps[i];&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # browser();&nbsp; # uncomment to pause the script's execution at this point</p>
<p>&nbsp; }</p>
<p>}</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="fig">Finding the highest value in a vector</p>
<h3>Using browser() to pause your script</h3>
<p>The <em><strong>for </strong></em>loop above is going through every value in the <em><strong>highTemps </strong></em>in order.&nbsp; Each time a new high temperature is found, <em><strong>highestTemp </strong></em>is set top that value.&nbsp; So, <em><strong>highestTemp </strong></em>is going to start at 0 (the initial value), and change multiple times.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If we put <em><strong>highTemps </strong></em>in the <em><strong>Console</strong></em>, we can see each time a new highest temperature will occur:</p>
<blockquote>
<p title="Console" class="nn">&gt; highTemps<br>&nbsp;[1] <em class="hl">57</em> 50 54 40 39 <em class="hl">58</em> <em class="hl">60 </em>53 55 44 39 54 <em class="hl">61</em> <em class="hl">75</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>A new highest temperature will be discovered 5 times: 57, 58, 60, 61, and 75 (iterations 1, 6 , 7, 13, and 14).</p>
<p></p>
<p>We can use<em><strong> browser() </strong></em>to see this, too.&nbsp; <em><strong>browser()</strong></em> is an instruction to pause the script in the middle of execution and put it in debug mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>If we uncomment the <em><strong>browser()</strong></em> line in <em class="ref" id="r-highVal">fig ##</em>:</p>
<p class="code nn">&nbsp;&nbsp; # browser();&nbsp; # uncomment to pause the script's execution at this point</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then the script will pause at that line when the condition <em><strong>if(</strong><strong>highestTemp &gt; highTemps[i]) </strong></em>is <strong>TRUE</strong>, which happens 5 times (out of 14 cycles) when <em><strong>i</strong></em> = 1, 6, 7, 13, and 14.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><em><strong>browser() </strong></em>will initially pause the script when <em><strong>i</strong></em> = 1 and you can click <em><strong>Continue</strong></em> to pause the script when <em><strong>i </strong></em>= 6, 7, 13, and 14.&nbsp; For now, the only other button you should know is <em><strong>Stop</strong></em>, which ends debug mode.</p>

<p class="fig">The script Sourced with <em><strong>browse()</strong></em> uncommented after <strong>Continue </strong>is clicked twice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Debug mode is a complicated topic that will be more fully explored in a future lesson.</p>
<h3>Initializing the state variable</h3>
<p>I initialized the state variable, <em><strong>highestTemp</strong></em>, to <strong>0</strong> -- and that works in this case because we know there are temperatures greater than 0.&nbsp; But, if all the temperatures were negative, then this would not work (I will let you answer why this would not work in the Application).&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>A better solution is to set the state variable to the first value in the vector (<em><strong>highTemps[1]</strong></em>).&nbsp; This makes the first value in the <em><strong>highTemps </strong></em>vector the default answer. &nbsp;In other words, if every condition check is <em><strong>FALSE</strong> </em>(i.e., no temperature is greater than the first) then the first temperature is the highest temperature.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="note">Note: this means you could start the indexing variable<strong> i</strong> at 2 instead of one.&nbsp; You do not need to test the 1st value against the 1st value -- there is no harm but it is a tiny bit inefficient.</p>
<p class="code">highestTemp2 = highTemps[1];&nbsp; # set the state variable to the first value in the vector</p>
<p class="code"><br>for(i in 1:numDays) # could be (i in 2:numDays)<br>{<br>&nbsp; if(highTemps[i] &gt; highestTemp2) # is this day's value greater than the current high<br>&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; highestTemp2 = highTemps[i];&nbsp; # set the state variable to the current day's value<br>&nbsp; }<br>}</p>
<p class="fig" id="highVal">Using a for loop to find the highest value in a vector</p>
<p></p>
<p>Whenever you are looking for the most extreme value in a vector, it is best to set the state variable to the first value in the vector.&nbsp; By doing this, you do not have to guess what kind of values you are going to get.</p>
<h2 class="" id="app">Application</h2>

<p></p>
<p>1) In comments answer: What happens if you set the state variable to 0 when trying to find the highest temperature if all temperatures are negative.</p>
<p>2) Find out <em><strong>if any</strong></em> of the even days were less than 40 degrees. Hint: use <em><strong>seq()</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>add code to exit the for loop as soon as the condition is met</li>
<li>add code that outputs to <em><strong>Console </strong></em>the first day that met the condition</li>
</ul>
<p>3) Find the mean low temperature using for loops: get the total and divide by the number</p>
<p>4) In one for loop find out how many days had:</p>
<ul>
<li>more than 1 inch of rain</li>
<li>between 0.1 and 1 inch of rain</li>
<li>less than 0.1 inches of rain</li>
</ul>
<p>5) Find out the lowest low temp and output to the <em><strong>Console </strong></em>the lowest temperature and the date it occurred on.</p>
<p>6) Make sure all the code above is generalizable so that it will also work with columns with any number of values (including from this <a href="../Scripts/LansingNOAA2016.csv" target="_self">weather data frame</a>).&nbsp; In comments: explain how your script is generalizable.</p>

<h2 id="truefalse" class="trap">Trap: Using T and F to represent TRUE and FALSE is a bad idea</h2>
<p>The terms <em><strong>TRUE</strong> </em>and <em><strong>FALSE</strong> </em>are reserved <em class="hl">keywords</em> in R (just like <em><strong>if, for, else</strong></em>...) -- this means that <em><strong>TRUE</strong> and</em> <em><strong>FALSE </strong></em>are predefined and<strong> </strong><em class="hl">cannot be used as variable names</em> in R.&nbsp;</p>
