<h3>Future Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add Qualtrics survey to all lessons?&nbsp; Or just at the end of the units?</li>

<h2>Welcome to Programming Fundamentals Using R and RStudio</h2>
<p>The purpose of this class is to introduce students to the principles of programming using R and RStudio.&nbsp; R and RStudio are powerful and versatile data analysis packages that are freely available. The R community is extensive and is constantly developing new tools that rival and, in many cases, surpass commercial statistical software and graphing packages.&nbsp; This class is designed for students new to programming.&nbsp; While the class focus is on R programming in RStudio, the programming skills taught (e.g., for loops, if-else statements, functions) are designed so that students can transfer their skills to other programming languages like C, JavaScript, or Python.</p>
<h3>Versions of the class</h3>
<p>There are two versions of this class. &nbsp;The assignments for both versions are the Applications in the lessons.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Version 1: For-credit<br></strong></p>
<p>This version is a three credit class with regular weekly assignments.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Version 2: Non-credit</strong></p>
<p>This version is self-paced and has no regularly scheduled class times but students are expected to complete the class within six months.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>About me...</strong></p>
<p>I started my career as a Software Engineer for Motorola in Arizona where I developed software for military radios. From there I became a high school teacher in Port Huron, MI where I taught Computer Science, Web Design, and Physical Science. After that, I worked as an Instructional Designer for the College of Education at MSU where my main project was developing the hybrid graduate program. I currently work at the QFC where my primary job is developing online classes, including this one.&nbsp; In my free time, you will often find me with a backpack deep in a forest or, as my picture testifies to, hanging out on a mountain in the Northern Cascades.</p>
<h3>Technical Support</h3>
<p>You can contact me, Charlie, regarding technical issues.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Class Requirements</h2>
<p>Students should be familiar with basic statistical concepts (e.g., mean, standard deviation, standard error).&nbsp; All material for this course is online -- no textbooks or any other purchases are required.</p>
<h3>Tech requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Hardware:</strong>&nbsp; Any Windows (10 or 11), Mac, or Linux machine from the past ten years that has updates installed can handle all the hardware and software requirements of this class.&nbsp; Preferably the computer has a webcam and microphone for videoconferencing.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Browser:</strong> You can use any browser (Firefox, Microsoft's Edge, Chrome, Safari) updated within the last couple of years.&nbsp; You will have issues using Microsoft's Internet Explorer, which was last updated in 2015.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Videoconferencing</strong>: We use <a href="http://zoom.us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoom </a>for our videoconference meetings.&nbsp; The meeting link will be emailed to you prior to the meeting.&nbsp; It is recommended that you download and test your camera and microphone on Zoom before attending an instructor meeting.&nbsp; The easiest way to do this is to go to the <a href="https://zoom.us/test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoom test page</a>.&nbsp; <em class="note">Note: Zoom's test page will download Zoom for you.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><em class="hl">To test your hardware in Zoom</em>, open Zoom and make sure you are on the <em><strong>Home</strong> </em>tab and click the <em><strong>Settings Icon</strong> </em>(right side- <em class="ref" id="r-zoom">fig ##</em>) and the <strong>Settings </strong>Window will open (right side- <em class="ref" id="r-zoom">fig ##</em>).&nbsp; Go to the <em><strong>Audio</strong> </em>and <em><strong>Video</strong> </em>tabs to test your microphone, speakers, and webcam.&nbsp; If you are using a Mac, the view is different but the buttons are the same.</p>

</ol>
<h3>Lesson applications</h3>
<p>All lessons have an <em><strong>Application</strong> </em>section at the end that will ask you to apply what you learned in the lesson in your own script. <em class="hl">The Application is the only product that gets evaluated.</em> There are no tests and there is no final exam.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Version 1 (for-credit):</strong></p>
<p>You will have multiple chances to finish the Applications as long as you hand them in on time.&nbsp; I would rather you hand in an incomplete Application then a late Application.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Version 2 (non-credit):</strong></p>
<p>The class is self-paced, however you should not go more than 2 weeks without handing in an application unless you inform the instructor that there will be a delay.&nbsp; You will have a chance to redo all applications.</p>
<h3>Lesson feedback</h3>
<p>Each application has these three questions regarding the lesson:</p>
<ol>
<li>What was your level of comfort with the lesson/application?</li>
<li>What areas of the lesson/application confused or still confuses you?</li>
<li>What are some things you would like to know more about that is related to, but not covered in, this lesson?</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>These questions are vital for feedback in this class and far more useful to me than end-of-class surveys as they give me real-time information.&nbsp;<em class="hl"> Please take a few minutes to answer these questions</em>.&nbsp; Feedback from these questions has become my main way of improving the class.&nbsp; In return, I promise to address concerns and questions from your responses.</p>
<h3>Extensions and Traps</h3>
<p>Many of the lessons contain optional content called <em><strong>Extension</strong> </em>and <em><strong>Traps</strong></em>.&nbsp; <em><strong>Extensions</strong> </em>contain material that goes beyond the lesson's objectives, and <em><strong>Traps</strong></em> capture some of the common issues students have with the lesson's objectives.&nbsp; There are links to <em><strong>Extensions</strong> </em>and <em><strong>Traps</strong> </em>within the Content area of the lesson.&nbsp; Clicking on the appropriate link takes you directly to the <em><strong>Extension</strong> </em>or <em><strong>Trap.</strong></em> <em class="ref" id="r-test">Extension: testing the extension link</em>.</p>
<h3>Downloading material for the class</h3>
<p>Each lesson will include a link to the script and data file used in the lesson.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All material used in the class is also available on <a href="https://github.com/QFCatMSU/FundProgUsingR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>, this includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Script and data files used in the lessons</li>
<li>Answers to all the lesson applications, including common programming mistakes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Student-Instructor Meetings</h2>
<p><strong>Version 1 (FW 491):</strong></p>
<p>Class will be every other Friday from 9-11 in 102 UPLA.&nbsp; Students can request a Zoom meeting at any time.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Version 2 (non-credit):</strong></p>
<p>Student-instructor meetings will be done on an as-needed basis and meetings can always be requested by the student.&nbsp; Meetings are done preferably using Zoom so that screens can be shared.</p>
<h2>Lesson features</h2>
<p>This section goes over some of the technological features built into the lessons</p>
<h3>Long-click menu</h3>
<p>If you long-click (hold left-button for about half a second) anywhere on any lesson page (<em class="ref" id="r-ff">fig ##, </em>try it!), you are given options to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to Top of Page</li>
<li>Print/ Save as PDF (same as the lesson's <em><strong>Print</strong> </em>link)</li>
<li>Return to the Previous Position (only appears after you have jumped to a position on the page)</li>
<li>Maximize All Images</li>
<li>Minimize All Images</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><img src="../images/R-00-LongClickMenu.PNG" alt="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" class="fs"></p>
<p class="fig" id="ff">The long-click menu -- this view is from Firefox</p>
<h3>Resizing Pictures</h3>
<p>Most pictures in the course can be resized so that the picture is out of your way when you don't need to view it.&nbsp; Clicking on the picture toggles it between the minimized and maximized states (<em class="ref" id="r-toggle">fig ##</em>).</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="../images/NinhBinh%20(Large).jpg" alt="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" class="fs"></p>
<p class="fig" id="toggle">Test picture to toggle (Ninh Bình, Việt Nam)</p>
<h3>Figures and references</h3>
<p>When you click on a figure reference (e.g., <em class="ref" id="r-toggle">fig ##</em>), the caption on the figure will highlight for 2 seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>If the figure is not on the screen, then the page will scroll to the figure and highlight it.&nbsp; For instance, clicking on <em class="ref" id="r-zoom">fig ##</em> will take you to the Zoom figure near the top of this page.&nbsp; You can return to this position by long-clicking and selecting <em><strong>Return to the Previous Position</strong></em></p>
<h3>Printing lessons and saving to PDF</h3>
<p>You can print any lesson or save it as a PDF by clicking on the <em><strong>Printer</strong> icon</em> at the top of every lesson (and this syllabus).&nbsp; This will bring up a print dialog (<em class="ref" id="r-pdf">fig ##</em>) and you can print the lesson to a printer.&nbsp; On most machines, you can also choose a PDF device as a printer -- this will save the lesson as a PDF document.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p class="note">Note: Using your browser's print feature instead of the <em><strong>Print</strong> </em>link, will print out the whole webpage instead of just the lesson.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><img src="../images/R-00-PDFPrinter.PNG" alt="" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" class="fs"></span></p>
<p class="fig" id="pdf">This author has two print-to-PDF devices -- the Microsoft Print to PDF, which comes with Windows 10, works fine</p>
<h4>Print-to-PDF Software (Windows 7 and 8 only)</h4>
<p>If you are still using Windows 7 or 8, you might not have a PDF device and you will need to download Print-to-PDF software. You can see if you have a PDF device by going to the print options in any program and see if any of the devices have "PDF" in their name (<em class="ref" id="r-pdf">fig ##</em>).&nbsp; If you don't have a PDF device, then I recommend you install&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cutepdf.com/products/cutepdf/writer.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CutePDF </a>(direct link to the <a href="http://cutepdf.com/download/CuteWriter.exe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">file download</a>).&nbsp; CutePDF is simple print-to-PDF software that does not try to install any extra software on your computer. <em class="ref" id="r-offers">Trap: Bloatware</em></p>
<h3>Codeblocks</h3>
<p>Double-clicking on a codeblock will select all the text in the codeblock and copy it to the clipboard -- you can then paste it into RStudio (or any other text editor).&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p class="code"># the next two lines should be at the top of all your scripts</p>
<p class="code">rm(list=ls());&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="code">options(show.error.locations = TRUE);</p>
<p class="code"></p>
<p class="code"># create three variables: d, t, and v</p>
<p class="code"># give d and t values and use them to calculate v</p>
<p class="code">d = 100;</p>
<p class="code">t = 20;</p>
<p class="code">v = d/t;</p>
</div>
<p class="fig" id="fullCode">Double clicking on the codeblock selects all the text and copies it to the clipboard</p>
<h2>Personal statement from Charlie</h2>
<p>The biggest thing that is lost when you move a class from a face-to-face environment to an online environment is the daily interaction between the instructor and the students.&nbsp; These interactions provide invaluable informal feedback for the instructor and, I would argue, are the main tool that an instructor uses to make improvements to their class.&nbsp; It is impossible to replicate this in an online class but I ask that you help me out and make an effort to communicate to me the little things.&nbsp; This could mean technical nags like content not appearing properly or pages loading too slowly, lesson content that is unclear, grammar and spelling issues, or scripts that do not work or work in a way that you do not understand.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you for reading and taking this into consideration.&nbsp; In the end, it is the interactions between an instructor and the students that make a class great.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now on to the stuff I have to put in a syllabus...</p>

<h2 class="trap" id="offers">Trap: Bloatware</h2>
<p>Adobe Acrobat, like most free software you download, attempts to bundle itself with software you most likely do not need nor want (i.e., bloatware).&nbsp; Make sure you take some time to read the optional offers whenever you download software. This author would argue that the main reason computers "slow" down over time is because of extra software that users unwittingly install.</p>
<p></p>
