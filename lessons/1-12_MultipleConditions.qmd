### Changes

## Purpose

-   Check for multiple conditions on variables

## Questions about the material...

The files for this lesson:

-   Script: [you can download the script here](../scripts/1-12_MultipleConditions.R)

-   Data: [download the data file here](../data/twoWeekWeatherData2.csv)

 

This lesson's data has two new columns in it compared to the previous lesson's data -- so 14 obs. of ***7*** variables (instead of 5).  The new columns (***noonCondMessy*** and ***precipBad***) are copies of the previous columns with some issues added that are addressed in this lesson.

## Logical Operators: AND (&), OR (\|)

In this lesson we are going to learn how to creaste conditional statements with multiple conditions using two new operators: ***AND***, ***OR***.  The symbol for the ***AND*** operator is the ampersand ( ***&*** ) and the symbol for the ***OR*** operator is the vertical pipe ( **\|** ).

 

[Note: In R, there are corresponding **&&** and **\|\|** operators.]{.note} For beginners in R, you almost always want to use ***&*** and ***\|***. For a detailed, and somewhat advanced, explanation of the difference go here: [Extension: & vs && and \| vs \|\|](#extension-vs-and-vs)

 

The ***AND*** operator combines two conditions into one conditional statement with the rule:

-   if [both]{.hl} of the conditions are **TRUE** then the whole conditional statement is **TRUE**

``` r
if (condition1 & condition2) # if both condition1 and condition2 are TRUE
{
   # Execute the code between these curly brackets
}
```

The **OR** operator combines two conditional statements into one conditional statement with the rule:

-   if [either]{.hl} of the conditional statements are **TRUE** then the whole conditional statement is **TRUE**

``` r
if (condition1 | condition2)  # if either condition1 or condition2 is TRUE
{
   # Execute the code between these curly brackets
}
```

### Operators we have learned so far

***&*** and ***\|*** are R [logical operators]{.hl} and now would probably be a good time to take a quick step back and look at all the operators we have learned in this class.

::: {#tbl-operators}
| Operator Type | Purpose | R Symbols |
|----|----|----|
| Assignment | assign a value to a variable | =, \<-, -\> |
| Mathematical | Perform a mathematical operation on a numeric value | +, -, \*, /, \^ |
| Subset | Subset a vector | \[ \], \$ |
| Conditional | Compare two values | ==, !=, \>, \<, \>=, \<= |
| Logical | Combine conditions | &, &&, \|, \|\| |

: All of the operators taught in the class so far
:::

## Combining conditional statements (logical operators)

In the last lesson we started by asking two questions about ***noonCond*** that both had one condition: 

1.  Is the day sunny? 

2.  Is the day rainy?

``` r
#### From last lesson
sunnyDays = 0; # state variable -- will hold the count of sunny days
rainyDays = 0; # state variable -- will hold the count of rainy days

for(i in 1:numDays)
{
  if(noonCond[i] == "Sunny")
  {
    sunnyDays = sunnyDays +1; # increases sunnyDays by 1
  # We use else if here because we know "Sunny" and "Rain" are mutually exclusive
  }else if(noonCond[i] == "Rain")
  {
    rainyDays = rainyDays +1; # increases rainyDays by 1
  }
}
```

And the answer was:

``` {.r tab="Environment"}
sunnyDays:   6
rainyDays:   3
```

### Using the OR operator

We can also combine the two conditional statements and ask: [Is the day sunny ***OR*** rainy?]{.hl}

 

Just replace ***OR*** with the symbol that represents ***OR***, which is \|:

``` r
  if(noonCond[i] == "Sunny" | noonCond[i] == "Rain")
```

Put this in the script and it will count days both sunny and rainy days:

::: {#fig-or-twoCondition}
``` r
sunnyOrRainyDays = 0
for(i in 1:numDays)
{
  if(noonCond[i] == "Sunny" | noonCond[i] == "Rainy")
  {
    sunnyOrRainyDays = sunnyOrRainyDays +1;
  }
}
```

Using logical operator \| to test two conditions
:::

***sunnyOrRainyDays*** is the addition of sunny (6) and rainy (3) days

``` {.r tab="Environment"}
sunnyOrRainyDays:   9
```

### Conditions must be explicit

In programming we need to be explicit with each condition in a conditional statement:

``` r
  if(noonCond[i] == "Sunny" | noonCond[i] == "Rainy")  # this is correct
```

In English, it makes sense to ask: Is the day sunny or rainy?

 

And, naively, the code for this English sentence would look like this:

``` r
  if(noonCond[i] == "Sunny" | "Rain")  # this in incorrect
```

If you do this, you will get the error:

[Error in noonCond\[i\] == "Sunny" \| "Rain" : invalid 'y' type in 'x \| y']{.hl}

where ***x*** represents `noonCond[i] == "Sunny"` and ***y*** represents `"Rain"`

 

The error is telling you that "Rain" (the invalid 'y') is not a valid conditional statement.  [Both conditions ('x \| y') must be explicitly written out]{.hl} (i.e., both conditions must have a conditional operator comparing two values).

### More than 2 conditions

You can also use the ***OR*** operator to put multiple conditions in a conditional statements.

 

We will use the new column in our data, called ***noonCondMessy*** in which the weather conditions are not consistently spelled -- as often happens when people are manually inputting data:

``` r
noonCondMess = weatherData$noonCondMessy;
```

Looking at the value in ***noonCondMess*** show that there are multiple versions of "sunny":

``` {.r tab="Console"}
> noonCondMess
[1] "clouds" "Cloudy" "sun" "rainy" " fog" "Sunny" "sunny"
[8] "cloudy" "Rain" "RAIN" "Snow" "SUNNY" "Sun" "sun"
```

We will use multiple ***OR*** operators to check for four different versions of "sunny":

::: {#fig-or-mult-spellings}
``` r
sunnyDaysMess = 0; # state variable -- will hold the count of sunny days

for(i in 1:numDays)
{
  # check for different spellings
  if(noonCondMess[i] == "Sunny" | noonCondMess[i] == "sunny" |
     noonCondMess[i] == "sun" | noonCondMess[i] == "SUN")
  {
    sunnyDaysMess = sunnyDaysMess +1;
  }
}
```

Using OR operator to check for multiple spellings
:::

And, once again we get six:

``` {.r tab="Environment"}
sunnyDays1:  6
```

[Note: This is a brute force method for finding multiple spellings.]{.note} There are more robust way to check for different spelling using substrings and pattern recognition (i.e., ***substr()*** and ***grep()***), topics we will touch on later in this class.

## The AND operator

The ***OR*** operator says: if one condition is **TRUE** then the conditional statement is **TRUE**

The ***AND*** operator says that all conditions need to be **TRUE** for the conditional statement to be **TRUE**.

 

The ***AND*** operator can be used to check conditions in two different weather columns.

 

For example, you might want to know which days were warmer than 60 ***AND*** Sunny.

::: {#fig-and-op-two-columns}
``` r
goOutDay = 0;

for(i in 1:numDays)
{
  if(highTemps[i] > 60 & noonCond[i] == "Sunny") 
  {
    goOutDay = goOutDay +1;
  }
}
```

Using AND operator to check conditions in two different columns
:::

There were 2 days that were both over 60 and sunny:

``` {.r tab="Environment"}
goOutDays:   2
```

[Note: day 7 is 60 degrees and sunny but not counted here because the condition ( **\>** ) is ***greater than*** (but not equal to) 60]{.note}

### The NOT EQUAL operator

We can reverse the conditions and check for non-sunny days that were colder than (or equal to) 50.

 

In other words we want ***highTemps*** [\<=]{.hl} 50 [AND]{.hl} ***noonCond*** [!=]{.hl} "Sunny":

::: {#fig-reverse-cond-statement}
``` r
stayInDay = 0;

for(i in 1:numDays)
{
  if(highTemps[i] <= 50 & noonCond[i] != "Sunny") 
  {
    stayInDay = stayInDay +1;
  }
}
```

Reversing the conditional statements from the last loop
:::

There were 5 days that were below (or equal to) 50 and not sunny:

``` {.r tab="Environment"}
stayInDays:    5
```

### Mutually exclusive if() statement

Since the two ***if()*** statements above (@fig-and-op-two-columns and @fig-reverse-cond-statement) have mutually exclusive conditional statements (i.e., there are no situations where both can be **TRUE**), we can (and should) combine them into one ***if-else-if*** statement.  The following code is functionally the same but more efficient:

::: {#fig-mutually-exclusive-mult-cond}
``` r
for(i in 1:numDays)
{
  if(highTemps[i] > 60 & noonCond[i] == "Sunny")
  {
    cat("day", i, " good day to go out\n");
  }else if(highTemps[i] <= 50 & noonCond[i] == "Rain")
  {
    cat("day", i, " good day to stay in\n");
  }
}
```

Checking mutually exclusive multiple conditions with an if-else-if structure
:::

The 2 days that are good to go out and 5 that are not:

``` {.r tab="Console"}
day 2 good day to stay in
day 4 good day to stay in
day 5 good day to stay in
day 10 good day to stay in
day 11 good day to stay in
day 13 good day to go out
day 14 good day to go out
```

## Finding Ranges of numbers

So far when we have used conditional operators on numbers that are bounded on one side but go off to infinity on the other.

-   ***highTemp \> 60*** means anything from 60 [up to positive infinity]{.hl}

-   ***highTemp \< 50*** means anything from 50 [down to negative infinity]{.hl}

 

However, we often want to limit the range we are checking to something less than infinity!

 

For instance we might want all values between 50 and 60.

 

In other words, we want:

-   values ***greater than or equal to*** 50 (***highTemps*** \>= 50)

-   ***AND*** values ***less than*** 60 (***highTemps*** \< 60)

 

In order for the value to be between 50 and 60 [both of the above conditions must be **TRUE**]{.hl}, so we use ***AND*** to combine the conditions:

::: {#fig-and-limit-range}
``` r
for(i in 1:numDays)
{
  # the number is both greater than (or equal to) 50 and less than 60
  if(highTemps[i] >= 50 & highTemps[i] < 60)
  {
    cat("It was ", highTemps[i], "degrees on day ", i, "\n");
  }
}
```

Using AND operator to limit the range to values between two numbers
:::

The 7 days between 50 and 60 (includes 50, exclude 60):

``` {.r tab="Console"}
It was 57 degrees on day 1
It was 50 degrees on day 2
It was 54 degrees on day 3
It was 58 degrees on day 6
It was 53 degrees on day 8
It was 55 degrees on day 9
It was 54 degrees on day 12
```

### Values outside a range

Sometimes we want to check for values outside an expected range, usually this in an error check.  For instance, ***precipBad*** has some values that seem problematic:

``` r
> precipBad
[1] 0.010 0.005 0.040 1.110 0.120 0.000 «-0.005» «49.000» 0.450 0.300
[11] 1.130 0.004 0.000 0.000
```

Since rain is in inches, we are going to assume that any negative value (less than 0) or value above 10 is an error.

 

In this case we are looking for  ***precipBad*** values that are less than 0 ***OR*** greater than 10:

::: {#fig-values-beyond-range}
``` r
precipBad = weatherData$precipBad;
for(i in 1:numDays)
{
  # precipBad values less than 0 or greater than 10
  if(precipBad[i] < 0 | precipBad[i] > 10)
  {
    cat("Day", i, "has a value of" , precipBad[i], "\n");
  }
}
```

Checking for values beyond the expected range
:::

And we see the two days in ***precipBad*** that are in error:

``` {.r tab="Console"}
Day 7 has a value of -0.005
Day 8 has a value of 49
```

## Boolean vectors {#sec-booleanVec}

Up until this point. we have been using conditional operators to check one value at a time.  We can also use conditional operators to check every value in a vector at once. The result will be a TRUE/FALSE (Boolean) vector of the same length as the vector checked.

 

For instance, we might want to know which days were sunny:

``` r
sunnyDayBool = (noonCondition == "Sunny");
```

Or, which days were both sunny and warm:

``` r
niceDayBool = (highTemps > 60 & noonCondition == "Sunny");
```

Or, which days had any precipitation (rain or snow):

``` r
precipBool = (precipitation == "Rain" | precipitation == "Snow")
```

The result for all three of these commands is a ***Boolean*** (a.k.a., ***logical***) vector with 14 values:

``` {.r tab="Environment"}
sunnyDayBool  logi [1:14] FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE...
niceDayBool   logi [1:14] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE...
precipBool    logi [1:14] FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE...
```

We can look at ***sunnyDayBool*** and see that the index of **the** **TRUE** values match the index of "Sunny" days in ***noonCond*** (values 3, 6, 7, 12, 13, and 14):

``` {.r tab="Console"}
> sunnyDayBool
 [1] FALSE FALSE  «TRUE» FALSE FALSE  «TRUE»  «TRUE» FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
[12] «TRUE»  «TRUE»  «TRUE»
> noonCond
 [1] "Cloudy" "Cloudy" «"Sunny"»  "Rain"   "Fog"    «"Sunny"»  «"Sunny"»  "Cloudy"
 [9] "Rain"   "Rain"   "Snow"  «"Sunny"»  «"Sunny"»  «"Sunny"» 
```

***niceDayBool*** shows that only the last two days were both Sunny and over 60 degrees:

``` {.r tab="Console"}
> niceDayBool
 [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
[12] FALSE  «TRUE»  «TRUE»
```

***precipBool*** shows that 4 of the 14 days had some precipitation (rain or snow):

``` {.r tab="Console"}
> precipBool
 [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  «TRUE» FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  «TRUE»  «TRUE»  «TRUE»
[12] FALSE FALSE FALSE
```

### Masking a dataframe

A common use for a Boolean vector is to reduce (or mask) a dataframe to rows that meet a condition.

We can create a dataframe that only contains the rows with sunny days using the Boolean vector ***sunnyDayBool***:

::: {#fig-maskdf}
``` r
### Using a Boolean vector to "mask" a dataframe 
sunnyDayWD = weatherData[sunnyDayBool,];
```

Masking a dataframe using \[X,Y\] subset notation
:::

In @fig-maskdf, we use \[X,Y\] notation to subset the dataframe with:

-   ***sunnyDayBool*** subsets ***X*** (the rows) – so only rows where ***sunnyDayBool*** is **TRUE** will be in the subsetted dataframe

-   nothing subsets ***Y*** (the columns) – so all columns will be in the subsetted dataframe

 

The subsetted dataframe, ***sunnyDayWD*** has 6 rows, representing the 6 (of the 14) rows from the original dataframe where ***noonCondition*** was **Sunny**:

``` {.r tag="Console"}
> sunnyDayWD
    date highTemp lowTemp precipitation «noonCondition» noonCondMessy precipBad
3  Mar29       54      46         0.040         Sunny           sun     0.040
6   Apr1       58      45         0.000         Sunny         Sunny     0.000
7   Apr2       60      32         0.005         Sunny         sunny    -0.005
12  Apr7       54      43         0.004         Sunny         SUNNY     0.004
13  Apr8       61      45         0.000         Sunny           Sun     0.000
14  Apr9       75      63         0.000         Sunny           sun     0.000 
```

[note: The row numbers (3,6,7,12,13,14) match the index of TRUE values in ***sunnyDayBool***]{.note}

### Masking rows and columns

We can use the ***\[X,Y\]*** notation to subset columns. The following code will keep column 1,2,3, and 5.

``` r
### Masking rows and columns
sunnyDayWD2 = weatherData[sunnyDayBool, c(1,2,3,5)]; # subset columns 1,2,3, and 5
```

And in the ***Console***, we see the same data with only columns 1, 2, 3, and 5:

``` {.r tag="Console"}
sunnyDayWD2                                                          
    date highTemp lowTemp noonCondition
3  Mar29       54      46         Sunny
6   Apr1       58      45         Sunny
7   Apr2       60      32         Sunny
12  Apr7       54      43         Sunny
13  Apr8       61      45         Sunny
14  Apr9       75      63         Sunny
```

### Masking with negative indexes

We can also use negative indexes to remove columns. The following code will remove columns 4 and 6.

``` r
### Masking rows and columns using negative indexes
sunnyDayWD3 = weatherData[sunnyDayBool, c(-4,-6)];  # remove columns 4 and 6
```

And in the ***Console***, we see the same data with the ***precipitation*** and ***noonCondMessy*** columns removed:

``` r
> sunnyDayWD3
    date highTemp lowTemp noonCondition precipBad
3  Mar29       54      46         Sunny     0.040
6   Apr1       58      45         Sunny     0.000
7   Apr2       60      32         Sunny    -0.005
12  Apr7       54      43         Sunny     0.004
13  Apr8       61      45         Sunny     0.000
14  Apr9       75      63         Sunny     0.000
```

## Application

A\) Create [one **if-else-if**]{.hl} structure that checks for:

-   Sunny days greater than 54

-   Non-Sunny less than or equal to 54

-   Sunny days less than or equal to 54

-   Non-Sunny greater than 54

In comments answer: Why do this as one ***if-else-if*** structure instead of 4 separate ***if*** statements?

 

B\) Create a Boolean (logical) vector that finds all cloudy days in ***noonCondMessy*** (include all the different spellings)

 

C\) Create a ***cloudyDays*** dataframe that:

-   Only has the rows from ***weatherData*** where weather conditions were cloudy

-   Removes the last 2 columns from ***weatherData*** (***noonCondMessy*** and ***precipBad***)

 

D\) Create a Boolean vector for ***noonCondition*** that is **TRUE** for all rainy, cloudy, and snowy days and **FALSE** for everything else.

 

E\) Find which days meet [all three]{.hl} of these conditions:

-   ***lowTemps*** \> 40

-   ***highTemps** \<* 60

-   Sunny

 

F\) Use the following random number generator:

``` r
randomTemp = sample(0:100, size=1);  # pick 1 random from 0 to 100
```

and create one ***if-else-if*** structure that outputs:

-   "error" if ***randomTemp*** is less than 20 or greater than 80

-   "very cold" if ***randomTemp*** is 20-30

-   "cold" if ***randomTemp*** is 30-45

-   "nice" if ***randomTemp*** is 45-60

-   "unusually warm" if ***randomTemp*** 60-80

## Extension: & vs && and \| vs \|\| {#extension-vs-and-vs}

R has two **AND** operators (**&** and **&&**) and two **OR** operators (**\|** and **\|\|**), which I will refer to as the [singles]{.hl} and [doubles]{.hl} operators.

 

The big difference is that ***singles*** work on one or multiple values, whereas ***doubles*** only work on one value. In other words, you can replace ***singles*** with ***doubles*** for the whole lesson except in @sec-booleanVec, where we are working with a vector of values (***doubles*** will cause an error here).

 

At this point it seems there is no reason to use ***doubles*** if ***singles*** do everything and more. And for a beginner, that is good enough. However, as you get into more advanced programming, there are benefits to using ***doubles***.

### doubles are more efficient

In the following code, ***&*** will ***always*** check both condition (1) ***highTemps*** \> 50 and (2) ***noonCond*** is Sunny:

``` r
  if(highTemps > 50 «&» noonCond == "Sunny") 
```

But if ***highTemps*** is less than 50 then there is no point to checking ***noonCond*** because the conditional statement has to be ***FALSE***.

 

***&&*** will only check what is necessary to get the condition making this code slightly more efficient:

``` r
if(highTemps > 50 «&&» noonCond == "Sunny")
```

if ***highTemps*** is less than 50, ***&&*** will not bother to check ***noonCond***.

### doubles can used to avoid errors

Another common usage of ***doubles*** is to check if a variable exists before checking the value of the variable. Here we are checking first to see if ***highTemps*** exists, then we will check if the value is greater than 50:

``` r
if( exists(highTemps) «&&» highTemps > 50 )  # will avoid errors
```

Because we are using ***&&***, when `exists(highTemps)` is ***FALSE***, the value of ***highTemps*** will not be checked.

 

If we use ***&***, then the value of ***highTemps*** will be checked even if ***highTemps*** does not exist, causing an error in your script.

``` r
 if( exists(highTemps) «&» highTemps > 50 ) # error if highTemps does not exist
```

### singles and double in other programming languages

In a lot of language, the ***doubles*** have a similar meaning to the ***singles*** in R. Just remember where you use ***singles*** in R, you are likely using ***doubles*** in other languages.
