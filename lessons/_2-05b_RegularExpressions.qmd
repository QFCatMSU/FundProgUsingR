### Regex

-   AI statement... awkwardness of RegEx

    -   clear way to do RegEx but it can be tricky to keep track of

-   Use baby names file

-   Find substring within string

    -   How many Rebeccas are there

-   at start of string (\^), at end of string (\$)

    -   names starting with

    -   names ending with

-   escape string (\\\\)

    -   R sees "\\\\" as one backslash and send that to regex

    -   let's say you want to find \^ or \$ within a string

    -   EX: Give a vector with multiple strings with \$ (you don't want \$ to mean end)

    -   And if you want to find a backslash...

-   one character options (multiple, range, all):

    -   \[Aa\] – (pick one from)one character chosen from this list

        -   difference between A\|B and \[AB\]

        -   special characters lose meaning in square brackets

    -   \[abcd\]

        -   Mari, Mary...

    -   \[\^abcd\]: now it means negation of everything in bracket

        -   names without the letters "a" or "e"

    -   any char: .

    -   any letter: \[a-zA-Z\]

    -   any number: \[0-9\]

    -   any letter or number: \[a-zA-Z0-9\]

-   How many characters:

    -   { min, max }

    -   Extension: some min, max have shortcuts

-   Grouping of characters

    -   (ab){3} matches ababab

    -   ab{3} or a(b){3} matches abbb

        -   there are reasons to do the latter (not covered in this lesson)

Challenge: Use ***grep()*** on the ***precip*** column in ***weatherType*** to ([note: **precip** is a string column]{.note}):

1.  find all precipitation values greater than or equal to 1.0 (hint: what is a unique substring for values \>= 1)

2.  find all precipitation values greater than or equal to 0.8

3.  find all days that have precipitation values greater than 0.8 and have maximum temperatures between 70-80

    -   use ***which()*** to find the temperatures
