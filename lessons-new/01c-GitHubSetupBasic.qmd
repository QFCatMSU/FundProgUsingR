### Two options for setup

The QFC is moving all student work to GitHub. Using GitHub (and Git) can be tricky for new students, so we’ve created two setup lessons to help you get started:

1.  [**Advanced**](01b-GitHubSetupAdv.html)**:** work directly in GitHub, giving you a more complete experience

2.  **Basic** (this lesson)**:** Hides most of GitHub from view, making it simpler to get started.

 

Both lessons require a GitHub account, which you can [sign up for here: https://github.com](https://github.com).

 

You can choose which lesson to do. If you choose the ***basic*** lesson, you must first email {{< var instructor.email >}} with you GitHub username. Your instructor will send you a GitHub URL to use.

## Purpose

-   Setup Git on your computer

-   Use Git to connect your RStudio Project to an instructor supplied GitHub repository

-   Upload changes to your project to the GitHub repository

## Install Git on your computer (version 2.44 or higher)

For this class, you will use Git to upload your classwork to a GitHub repository supplied by the instructor

 

For ***Windows***, [go here to download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) -- click on ***Download for Windows***. Git asks a lot of questions during installation and you can choose the default option for everything.

 

For ***Mac***, [there is no direct installation of Git]{.hl}. I recommend using **Homebrew**, which is a useful tool for any programmer using a Mac because it gives you access to a bunch of programming tools.

### Homebrew installation of Git on Mac:

-   Go to the [Homebrew homepage](https://brew.sh/)

-   Copy the text under the heading ***Install Homebrew***

-   Paste the text in a ***Terminal*** window (RStudio has a ***Terminal*** tab in the bottom-left pane)

    -   Be patient -- it takes time to install!

-   When Homebrew is finished installing, install ***Git*** by typing in the ***Terminal***:

``` bash
brew install git 
```

-   And then install the credential manager by typing in the Terminal:

``` bash
brew install --cask git_crendential_manager
```

#### Alternate installation for Git on Mac

If you cannot get ***Homebrew*** to work, [other options are available here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac). ***MacPort*** is the best alternative. ***XCode*** will work but it is a huge installation (at least 20GB), and most of it is not going to be used. The ***Binary Installer*** option is too outdated.

## RStudio Terminal

We will be using the ***Terminal*** tab in RStudio to setup Git and to connect your project to a repository on GitHub. The ***Terminal*** in RStudio is a tab in the lower left area in RStudio. The ***Terminal*** tab is similar to the Command Prompt in Windows or Terminal in Mac

 

Most of the Terminal command used in this lesson will only work if you are in the correct RStudio Project. The RStudio Project name (in @fig-RStudioTermProj it is ***My_Project***) is in the upper-right corner of RStudio (circled in red).

## Configuring Git on your computer

Before you use Git, you need to configure Git on your computer with your GitHub username and email (i.e., the email you use to sign up for your GitHub account). We will use the RStudio ***Terminal*** tab to enter these values.

### Adding the username and email

The first command sets the user name in Git (replace ***userName*** with your GitHub ID):

``` {.bash tab="Terminal"}
git config --global user.name "userName"
```

The second command sets the user ***email*** in Git (replace ***email*** with the email you used to signup for GitHub):

``` {.bash tab="Terminal"}
git config --global user.email "email"
```

![Changing Git username and email using the Terminal tab](images/GH_EmailAndUsername.png){#fig-terminalTab .fs}

### Viewing the configured values (optional)

You can check if you successfully changed the username and email by executing these lines in the ***Terminal*** tab:

``` {.bash tab="Terminal"}
git config user.name 
git config user.email
```

After executing the two above command, your **Terminal** tab should look similar to this:

::: {#fig-testGitConfig}
``` {.bash tab="Terminal"}
$ git config user.name 
belinskyc  
$ git config user.email 
belinsky@msu.edu
```

Testing the git configuration using the RStudio Terminal tab

## Add Git Repository to your RStudio Project folder

Both RStudio Projects and Git Repositories are set up in your Project Folder (i.e., the root folder for your project).

 

To add a Git repository to your Project Folder,make sure your RStudio Project is open (@fig-RStudioTermProj) and type in the Terminal:

``` bash
git init -b main
```

You should get a message in the Terminal like:

``` bash
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/Charlie/...
```

Now restart RStudio and Git should be ready to go

### RStudio Git tab

After you add Git to an RStudio Project folder, a ***Git*** tab will appear in the upper-right window. This tab is RStudio's built-in Git interface and it can handle many commonly performed Git functions, including most of the things needed for class. The ***Git*** tab is often helpful but not necessary.

![The Git tab has been added to the RStudio Project](images/GH_02_GitTab.png){#fig-GitTab .fs}

## Linking your Git repository to a GitHub repository

In this section we are going to link your Git repository, which is in the same folder as your RStudio Project, with the GitHub Repository provided be your instructor.  The GitHub repository will become the online version of your Git repository.

 

Type the line below into the ***Terminal***. [Replace the URL with the URL given to you by your instructor.]{.hl}

``` bash
git remote add origin "https://github.com/myUserName/myRepository.git"
```

[Note: In Windows, **Control-V** does not paste in a Terminal window, but **right-click** -\> **Paste** works]{.note}

### If you added the wrong repository name

Then you first need to remove the current GitHub repository (i.e., the ***origin***):

``` bash
git remote rm origin
```

and then repeat this line (using the correct GitHub URL)

``` bash
git remote add origin "https://github.com/myUserName/myRepository.git"
```

## Uploading to the GitHub repository

[Changes to your local project are not automatically uploaded to GitHub]{.hl} – you need to explicitly upload the changes.

 

To upload your changes to GitHub, in the ***Terminal*** type:

``` bash
git add -A
git commit -m "A message about the changes to your project"
git push -u origin main
```

You will repeat these lines every time you turn in an application.

-   The first line compiles all the changes you have made to your project

-   The second line accepts, and adds a message about, your changes

-   The third line sends the changes with the message to GitHub.

    -   After the first push, the third line can be reduced to `git push`

### Authenticating with GitHub

GitHub will ask for authentication [the first time you connect to a GitHub repository]{.hl} on a computer:

![GitHub asking for authentication](images/GitHubLogin-new.png){#fig-GitHubAuth .fs}

When you click ***Sign in with your browser***, your default browser will open to the GitHub login page.

 

After you login you will get an Authentication Successful window:

![The Authentication Successful window](images/GH_Repo_AuthSuccess.jpg){#fig-authSuccess .fs}

## Application

A\) Append to the top of your ***app01.r*** the [Questions to answer] for this lesson.

B\) Send the change to GitHub by executing these lines in the ***Terminal***:

``` bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Finished lesson 1b application"
git push
```

Alternatively, you can use the Git tab to add, commit, and push: [Extension: Use Git Tab]

 

[The first time you ***push*** your project you have to use this command and the Git tab will not work:]{.note}

``` bash
git push -u origin main
```

C\) Email your instructor the application is done

-   When you Push, the instructor should get an email from GitHub, so this part is just to double-check that everything is working

### Questions to answer

Answer the following in comments inside your application script:

1.  What was your level of comfort with the lesson/application?

2.  What areas of the lesson/application confused or still confuses you?

3.  What are some things you would like to know more about that is related to, but not covered in, this lesson?

## Extension: Use Git Tab

The ***Git*** tab can be used instead of the Terminal to sync changes from your Project Folder to your GitHub repository.

1.  In the ***Git*** tab, click ***Commit*** and the ***RStudio Review Changes*** window appears

2.  On the left, check the files you want to sync with your GitHub repository (you do not have to check all of them)

3.  On the right side, put a message in that describes the changes

4.  Click ***Commit*** in the lower right

5.  Close the window that pops up (not pictured)

6.  click ***Push*** in the upper-right

7.  Close the windows
