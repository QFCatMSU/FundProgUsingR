### To do

-   Explain how Git is being used in this class and its potential use
-   add images to assets folder

### Positron Issues

-   Positron slow to load R Console after computer restarts/ computer has been on a while
    -   Windows-only issue: Defender antivirus scan issue – need to exclude these folders:
        -   c:\\Program Files\\R
        -   c:\\Users\\\<username\>\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Positron

### Differences from RStudio

-   Default Source ([echo]{.hl} means the code prints to Console)

    -   Positron: includes echo

    -   RStudio: no echo

-   Working directories / Project Folders:

    -   Positron opens folders and sets working directory to the folder

    -   RStudio open \*.Rproj files and sets working directory to the folder that contains the RProj file

## Purpose

-   Install, setup, and test the software you will need for this class

-   Provide a basic overview of the Positron environment

-   Execute an R script in Positron

-   Use Git and GitHub to save class work

    -   This is far from a Git/GitHub tutorial – it is just enough to get your project folder on GitHub

## Questions about the material...

If you have any questions about the material in this lesson, feel free to email them to the instructor, {{< var instructor.name >}}, at {{< var instructor.email >}}.

## Install R, Positron and Git on your computer

We are going to install **R**, **Positron**, and **Git** on your computer. R is a programming language, Positron provides a structured environment for the R programming language, and Git is a version management system that allows you to save your work online at github.com.

 

For Windows, the installation is straightforward and you can use the default settings for all programs. For Macs the installation of Git is a little harder.

 

[Note: Even if you already have the software installed, it is a good idea to verify you have a recent version.]{.note}

### Install or update R (recommend version 4.5 or higher)

The [R for Windows download is here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/). Click on ***Download R 4.#.# for Windows***.\
 \
The [R for Mac download is here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/).  

-   There are two versions of R for Mac 

    -   ***R-4.#.#-arm64.pkg***: for newer Macs (starting in 2021) with Apple Silicon processors (M1, M2,...)

    -   ***R-4.#.#-x86_64.pkg***: for older Macs with Intel-based processors

-   The installer will tell you If you pick the wrong ***pkg*** file -- there is no harm except a bit of wasted time.

 

Linux user: the [R installation instruction for major distributions are here.](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/) However, these instructions are inadequate for many distributions – you probably will have to search how to install R on your distribution.

### Install or update Positron (need at least version 2026.02)

[You can download Positron here](https://positron.posit.co/download.html). Don't forget to accept the Positron legal agreement before downloading.

 

There are two Windows installation files: system-level and user-level. [User-level is probably what you want]{.hl} unless you are installing this on a computer where there are multiple users who are all going to use the same settings.

 

Just like R, there are two Mac installations: Apple Silicon (new) and Intel (old).

### Install or update Git (Windows)

For ***Windows***, [go here to download the latest version of Git](https://git-scm.com/install/windows). Git asks a lot of questions during installation – the default options are fine.

### Install or update Git (Mac)

[There is no direct Git installation on Mac](https://git-scm.com/install/mac). ***Homebrew*** is the best option and Homebrew is a useful tool for any programmer using a Mac because it gives you access to a bunch of programming tools.

 

To install Git on a Mac:

-   Go to the [Homebrew homepage](https://brew.sh/)

-   Copy the text under the heading ***Install Homebrew***

-   Paste the text in a ***Terminal*** window (Positron has a ***Terminal*** tab in the bottom-left pane)

    -   Be patient -- it takes time to install!

-   When Homebrew is finished installing, install ***Git*** by typing in the ***Terminal***

    -   You can use the Mac Terminal or the Terminal in Positron (@fig-ConsoleTerminal):

``` bash
brew install git 
```

-   And then install the credential manager by typing in the ***Terminal***:

``` bash
brew install --cask git_crendential_manager
```

## Console and Terminal tabs

We are going to use both the ***Console*** and ***Terminal*** tabs inside Positron to execute commands. The Console tab runs programming language commands (in this case, R) and the Terminal runs operating system commands. The Terminal tab is linked to Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux).

![Console and Terminal tabs in Positron](images/R_1-01_ConsoleTerminal.png){#fig-ConsoleTerminal .fs}

## Configuring Git (Terminal tab)

Before you use Git, you first need to configure Git on your computer with your GitHub username and email (i.e., the email you use to sign up for your GitHub account). The username and email are used by Git to identify who made what changes in the project history.

### Adding the username and email

We will use the Positron ***Terminal*** tab (@fig-ConsoleTerminal) to set these values.

 

The first command sets the user name in Git (replace ***Your_GitHub_ID*** with your GitHub ID):

``` {.bash tab="Terminal"}
git config --global user.name "«Your_GitHub_ID»"
```

The second command sets the user ***email*** in Git (replace ***Your_GitHub_email*** with the email you used to signup for GitHub):

``` {.bash tab="Terminal"}
git config --global user.email "«Your_GitHub_Email»"
```

### Viewing the configured values

Git does not check if your ***user.name*** and ***user.email*** are valid. You can check the username and email by executing these lines in the ***Terminal*** tab:

``` {.bash tab="Terminal"}
git config user.name 
git config user.email
```

After executing the two above command, your **Terminal** tab should look similar to this:

::: {#fig-testGitConfig}
``` {.bash tab="Terminal"}
$ git config user.name 
belinskyc   
$ git config user.email 
belinsky@msu.edu
```

Testing the git configuration using the RStudio Terminal tab
:::

## Installing a package (Console tab)

***GGPlot2***, is a widely used package that does not come with R -- so we are going to install the ***GGPlot2*** package using the ***Console*** tab.

 

Type the following in the Console and press ***enter***:

``` r
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

![Install an R package using the Console](images/R-01_PackageInstall-2.png){#fig-packageInstall .fs}

 

***GGPlot2*** requires many other packages (its dependencies) -- and RStudio will install those packages along with GGPlot2.  Be patient, as this could take a little time.

 

[Extension: Positron R Package Manager Extension]

## Positron and Project Folders

Most of the work you will do in R involves multiple scripts, data files, and probably other file types.  All these files together make up your project and they should exist within a self-contained [Project Folder]{.hl}, which is a folder that contains all the files and subfolders for your project. It is the Project Folder that gets uploaded to GitHub.

### Create a new Project Folder

Create a new folder in any location on your computer and name the folder something appropriate (I named it ***My_Project***).

 

To open the new folder as a Project Folder in Positron:

-   click ***Open*** -\> ***Open Folder...***

-   Navigate to the folder location

-   Click on Folder and click ***Select Folder***

 

[Note: you can also use the Positron interface to create a new folder (***New -\> New Folder from Template...***), but, for now, there is no advantage to it.]{.note}

![Opening a new project folder in Positron -- this view is the Explorer tab](images/R-1-01_NewProjectFolder.png){#fig-newProjFolder .fs}

### Isolating a project

When you click **Open** in Positron, you can choose **Open File…** or **Open Folder…**. Most of the time, [you should open a folder first]{.hl} and then open your script from inside the folder. Positron treats that folder as a container for all of your work, creating a self-contained space where your scripts, data, and other files reside. This makes it easier for files to find each other (e.g., when a script reads a data file) and helps ensure that new files are saved in the right place. Keeping your work isolated to one folder (and its subfolders) makes it much easier to share the project on GitHub.

 

For those who have worked in R before, Positron also sets this folder as the ***Working Directory***.

### Add subfolders

The Positron ***Explorer*** tab is a File Manager and allows you to do most of the things that you can do in your operating systems File Manager (called **File Explorer** in Windows and **Finder** in Mac). The ***Explorer*** tab can be used to open, add, remove, rename files and folders, and drag-and-drop files.

 

We will use the ***Explorer*** tab in Positron (top-left tab) to create two subfolders: ***scripts*** and ***data***.

 

To add two folders named ***scripts*** and ***data***:

-   Click on ***New Folder*** icon next to the Project Folder name (highlighted in @fig-newFolders)

    -   note: you can also right-click inside the area and choose ***New Folder...***

-   Enter ***scripts*** in the textbox and click ***OK***

-   Repeat the last two steps to add a folder called ***data***

    -   [Make sure you put ***data*** inside the project folder]{.hl} – not inside the ***scripts*** folder

![Adding folders to your project folder](images/R-1-01_NewFolders.png){#fig-newFolders .fs}

### Add files to the project

Now we will download two files and add them to your Project Folder.

-   [Setup.r](../scripts/Setup.R): put this file in your ***scripts*** directory

-   [Setup.csv](../data/Setup.csv): put this file in your ***data*** directory

You can either put the files in the directories using your File Explorer or you can drag-and-drop the file into the folder using ***Explorer*** in Positron (@fig-drag_drop).

![Drag and drop a file into your project folder](images/R-1-01_Drag_Drop.png){#fig-drag_drop .fs}

### File extensions and hidden files

By default, the ***Explorer*** tab in Positron shows file extensions and most hidden files. Windows and Mac File Explorers do not do this by default – you can change that behavior here: [Extension: Viewing file extensions and hidden files]

## Positron Basics

Now we are going to execute the script file, ***Setup.R***, that we just downloaded to your Project's ***scripts*** folder*.*

 

***Setup.R*** takes weather data from the other downloaded file, ***Setup.csv*** and creates boxplots showing how Wind Direction and Wind Speed relate to the Change In Temperature.

 

We are executing the script to test your setup and help you become familiar with the Positron environment – not to teach the code in the script (although some will be taught later in class)

### Open your Project folder in Positron

Position remembers the last opened Project Folder, but let's start from scratch and close the project folder by clicking ***File -\> Close Folder***. Now we have a clean Positron window without anything open.

 

There are multiple ways to open a Project Folder in Positron -- three of them are:

-   In Positron, click ***Open*** -\> ***Open Folder...*** -\> navigate to the Project Folder and click ***Select Folder***

    -   It is likely that the folder is already in the recently opened list (circled in @fig-open_proj_folder)

-   In Positron, click the folder icon in the upper-right corner and click ***Open Folder***, or choose a Project Folder that has recently been opened (highlighted in @fig-open_proj_folder)

-   You can drag and drop a folder into Positron

![Opening a project in Positron](images/R-1-01_OpenFolder.png){#fig-open_proj_folder .fs}

### Open and execute a script file in your Project

To open the script file, in the Explorer tab navigate to the ***script*** folder and click on the script inside. It will open in an editor tab.

 

To execute or the entire script, or [Source]{.hl}, click on the right arrow.

 

After the script is sourced:

-   The **Console** tab displays information about the execution of the script.

-   The **Session** tab displays information generated from the execution of the script including ***Variables*** (e.g., ***weatherData***, ***windLabels***) and ***Plots***

![Executing an R script (Source)](images/R-1-01_Source.png){#fig-source .fs}

### Cleaning up the Positron panes

There many times where you want to clean up the panes, which can get very crowded with information from old script executions.

-   To clean the **Console,** ***Variables***, and **Plot** panes, use the ***X*** button (underlined in @fig-source).

 

If you click ***Source*** again, the panes will once again be populated with data from the script's execution.

## Saving your Project Folder to GitHub

We are going to save you project folder on GitHub so that it can be shared with the instructor. To complete this section, [you need to have a GitHub account](https://github.com).

 

Steps 4-9 are only needed the first time you publish a project to GitHub on a computer because GitHub needs to authenticate your computer and your ID.

### Upload your project to GitHub

**In Positron** (@fig-sourceControl)

1.  Make sure everything is saved

2.  Click on the ***Source Control*** button on the left-vertical bar in Positron (circled in @fig-sourceControl)

3.  Click ***Publish to GitHub***

4.  Click ***Allow*** so that the extension can sign in to GitHub

5.  You will get a code to use on GitHub, click ***Copy & Continue to GitHub***

 

**On GitHub** (@fig-githubauth):

6.  You will have to log in to GitHub and click ***Continue*** for Device Activation

7.  Paste the code to authorize the device and click ***Continue***

8.  And then click ***Authorize Visual-Studio Code*** ([note: Positron is based on VSCode]{.note})

9.  A message should appear that you have successfully completed registration – go back to Positron

 

**Back in Positron** (@fig-publish):

10. In the top text box, choose to publish the project publicly or privately (for this class it does not matter) and click ***enter***

11. Make sure all files are selected (default) and click ***OK***

![Source control tab in Positron](images/R-1-01_SourceControl.png){#fig-sourceControl .fs}

![Steps 6-8 in browser on GitHub.com](images/R-1-01_GitHubAuto.png){#fig-githubauth .fs}

![Publishing project on GitHub](images/R-1-01_Publish.png){#fig-publish .fs}

## View project on GitHub

Your project folder is now on GitHub in a repository. Let's go to your GitHub account to verify that the project files are there (@fig-GitHubPostPublish):

1.  Log in to GitHub

2.  On the left side, there is a section called ***Repositories***. 

3.  Click on the repository called ***\<your-user-name\>***/**\<your-repository-name\>**

4.  Choose the ***Code*** tab (you are probably already on it)

![GitHub repository after publishing](images/R-1-01_GitHubRepo.png){#fig-GitHubPostPublish .fs}

From here you can click on the ***script*** and ***data*** folders to see what is in them. For this class, we are not going to be using the online repository for anything except storage.

### Inviting the instructor to your repository

Lastly, you need to give the instructor access to the repository.

 

To invite a user (or, as GitHub calls them, ***collaborator***) to your repository:

1.  Go to the GitHub home page for your repository and click ***Settings***

2.  Click ***Collaborators***

3.  Click ***Add people***

4.  In ***Find people*** textbox, you can use either the person's GitHub ID or their email

    -   invite your instructor: {{< var instructor.email >}}

5.  Click ***Add to repository***

![Inviting a user to your GitHub Repository](images/R-1-01_Invite.png){#fig-invite .fs}

## Application

This process is easier if the ***Explorer*** tab is open (e.g., @fig-drag_drop)

1.  In your Project Folder, create a new script file (***File*** -\> ***New File*** -\> ***R File R*** )

2.  Copy and paste this lesson's script, ***Setup.r***, to the new script.

3.  Change the colors in the boxplot (lines 16-19)

    -   Here is a [comprehensive list of color names](images/rcolornames.pdf) you can use in R

4.  Save the script to your ***script*** folder as ***app01.r***

 

{{< include ../assets/_AppInstructions_Pos.qmd >}}

## Extension: Working directories in R

In R, the [working directory]{.hl} is the default folder where R looks for files. For example, you might see a line like this in a script:

``` r
weatherData = read.csv(file="data/weatherData.csv")
```

Here, R will look for the file ***weatherData.csv*** inside a folder named ***data*** that is located in the current working directory. How R determines the working directory is not intuitive—it could be your R installation folder, the folder where the script was last run, or some other default depending on your setup. To work around this, many people used an absolute path or ***setwd()*** to change the working directory, like this:

``` r
# Using an absolute path
weatherData = read.csv(file="C:/Users/YourName/Documents/WeatherProject/data/weatherData.csv")  

# Or changing the working directory first 
setwd("C:/Users/YourName/Documents/WeatherProject") 
weatherData = read.csv(file="data/weatherData.csv")
```

While these approaches work immediately, they are not portable. If the script is shared or moved, the path will not exist, and the script will fail.

 

Modern tools like **Positron** solve this problem with [project folders]{.hl}. When you open a project, Positron automatically sets the project folder as the working directory. In this setup, your script can simply use the relative path ***data/weatherData.csv*** without worrying about absolute paths. This keeps your code portable and self-contained—you can move or share the project folder, and the script will still work.

## Extension: Run vs. Source {data-link="Extension: Run vs. Source"}

The difference between ***Run*** and ***Source*** is:

-   ***Source*** will execute all the code in a script file.

-   ***Run*** will execute either:

    -   The code that is highlighted (if code is highlighted) ***OR***

    -   The command that the cursor is on (if the command is on more than one line) ***OR***

    -   The whole line the cursor is on

 

As R has grown, the focus has shifted towards developing well-structured code just like any modern programming language (e.g., Python, C, Java). [This means executing the script as a whole instead of in parts.]{.hl}  This is what ***Source*** does.  Executing your script as a whole instead of in parts has many advantages as the code is easier to debug, easier to share, and much better organized -- because you are forced to organize it. In the not-so-humble opinion of this author, learning to treat your script as a whole is a vital part of learning how to program.  For this reason, we will mostly be using ***Source*** in this class. 

## Extension: Create a standalone R script

There are two ways to create script file in Positron:

1.  A standalone script

2.  As part of an Project Folder

 

Many people use the first method.  In this class we exclusively use the second method.  The first method of creating a script file is fine for testing something out.  The second method is far better for organizing larger projects and sharing your code with others.

 

The reason the second method is better is because a project consist of many file that need to talk each-other.  Script files will call other scripts file or read in data from data files.  In order to makes this work, the script files need to know how to find the other files. In a Project Folder, this is easy because the working directory is always the Project Folder -- and all files in the project are contained within the Project Folder.  So, you just need to look for the file relative to the Project Folder.

 

R Programmers often get around the lack of a Project Folder/defined working directory by setting the working directory in code using ***setwd()***.  This can work locally but becomes problematic when files are shared or moved.  Whereas, Project Folders always maintain their folder structure.

## Extension: Viewing file extensions and hidden files

By default, Windows and Mac hides file extensions from you (e.g., your Word document file is listed in the file manager as ***stuff*** instead of ***stuff.docx***).  This is not convenient when you are programming as you are working with many file types (e.g., \*.txt, \*.r, \*.csv) and, many times, the only difference between the name of two files is the extension.  For instance, you might have two files called ***weather.r*** and ***weather.csv*** in your folder -- without file extensions they are both listed as **weather**.

 

Also, when you are programming, there are files you will need to access that are hidden by default in the operating system.

 

This section is optional, but I would highly recommend you learn how to view all hidden files and file extensions -- it will greatly assist you when programming.

### Viewing in newer versions of Windows 11

This is easy to to do in newer versions of Windows 11:

-   Open the File Explorer

-   Click ***View*** -\> ***Show***

-   Check ***File name extensions*** and ***Hidden items***

![Change settings to view all file extensions on Windows 11](images/RSProj_FileExtensions_Win11.png){#fig-win11 .fs}

### Viewing in Windows 10 and older Windows 11 versions

This feature is a bit buried in these Window versions.

 

-   Open any ***File Explorer*** window (i.e., your folder viewer)

-   In menu bar

    -   **Windows 10**: click ***View*** -\> ***Options*** -\> ***Change folder and search options***

    -   **Windows 11**: click ***3 dots*** ( **· · ·** ) -\> ***Options***

-   In ***Folder Options*** window (@fig-fileExt), go to the ***View*** tab

-   Uncheck ***Hide extensions for known file types***

-   Check ***Show hidden files, folder, and drives***

-   Click ***OK***

![Viewing in older versions of Windows](images/RSProj_FileExtensions1.png){#fig-fileExt .fs}

### Viewing in Mac

File Extensions:

-   Open ***Finder***

-   Click on ***Finder*** -\> ***Preferences...***

-   In ***Finder Preferences*** window click on the ***Advanced*** tab

-   Check ***Show all filename extensions***

 

Hidden files:

-   You can temporarily see hidden files in the Finder by pressing ***Command-Shift-Dot ( . )***. 

-   You can use the Terminal to permanently show hidden files as [described on this webpage](https://techstacker.com/how-to-always-show-hidden-files-finder-macos/) but this is not recommended unless you are comfortable with Terminal commands.

![Change settings to view all file extensions on a Mac](images/RSProj_FileExtensionsMac.png){#fig-fileExtMac .fs}

## Extension: Positron R Package Manager Extension

There is an extension for Positron that replicates most of the features of the Package Manager in RStudio. You can install Positron extensions by clicking the 5th button down in the vertical bar on the left (circled). After installation, a new icon will appear at the bottom of the vertical bar (circled) – this is the package manager. Make sure you are installing the version by user ***kv9898***.

 

This package is very useful but in a quick development cycle, which is why I am not officially including it in the class.

## Orphaned material

In RStudio, Project Folders are created by putting an \*.Rproj file inside the folder you want designated as a Project Folder. When you open a folder in Positron, it automatically opens as a Project Folder – there is nothing extra you need need to do.

 

[note: RStudio will add an \*.RProj file to the Project Folder – this file will not affect anything in Positron.]{.note}
